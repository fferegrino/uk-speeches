We do not believe that is the case. My predecessor, my hon.

        "On protecting farmers\u2014again, a hot topic in previous debates\u2014in both the Australia and New Zealand FTAs, the UK secured a range of measures to safeguard our farmers, including tariff rate quotas for a number of sensitive agricultural products and product-specific safeguards for beef and, for Australia, sheepmeat, alongside a general bilateral safeguard mechanism providing a temporary safety net for all products.
