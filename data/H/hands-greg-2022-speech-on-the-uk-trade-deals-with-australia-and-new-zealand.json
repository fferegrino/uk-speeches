        "I am delighted to respond, because I have had extensive interaction with all the five nations\u2019 NFUs during this process. We have delivered a deal that phases in the changes. The right hon. Gentleman might reference the fact that the trade deal we have with the European Union, which he supported, gives the EU comprehensive access from day one. This deal phases in access for Australia and New Zealand for a period of up to 15, and in some cases 20, years. I think that is worth consideration, as is the extensive interaction we have had with the NFU and with farmers.

        "I disagree with that. I am just checking my records and I have had extensive interactions with representatives of NFU Cymru during the negotiation process.

It was important for us to get the confidence of the farming community in Wales and I also did various Zoom calls at the time\u2014this was during one of the lockdowns\u2014with MPs and their constituent farmers. The protections we have in the deal are very considerable. For example, the tariff rate quotas carry on for 10 years in some cases, and there are product-specific measures to protect sensitive agriculture produce from years 10 to 15 as well as bilateral safeguard mechanisms.

Let me take him back to his earlier comments about the strategic value of this. Does he understand that trade deals must have strategic value when it comes to protecting our ability to feed ourselves as a country? Does he understand why those of us who represent rural communities are deeply concerned about the imbalance that exists between farm standards on this side of the world and those in New Zealand and Australia on the other?

I have already pointed out the safeguards that exist in both deals: the long transition period and the substantial tariff-rate quotas.
