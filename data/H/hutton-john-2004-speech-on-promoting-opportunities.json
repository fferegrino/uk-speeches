To help us break down barriers that had so often held people back in the past.

        "The Government is committed to supporting NHS Employers to become better employers. We have this responsibility because, I think, of the position the NHS occupies in the life of our country. Because for me and everyone else here the NHS represents a set of values. Fairness. Equality. Compassion. Respect for the individual. Decent values that reflect the powerful instinct of the our people for fairness and tolerance. If we are to properly discharge our responsibilities as the main provider of healthcare services in Britain today, we have to embed these values in the way we behave as an employer. Because we recognise that to improve the care we provide our patients we do need to improve the way we look after our staff. This means we will need to confront discrimination and prejudice within our own organisation. Because it is there. It does exist.
