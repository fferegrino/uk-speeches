Churchill and Roosevelt, who spent more time together than any other leaders of our countries in history and presided over the most gargantuan achievements of Anglo-American co-operation, had many sharp disagreements over the conduct of World War II and its aftermath. Margaret Thatcher famously complained to Ronald Reagan over the invasion of Grenada. Washington and London had a fundamental and very public disagreement over Suez, and again over the Balkans in the 1990s.
