Instead, we are setting out what practices are entitled to receive as a budget and how any disputes about the budget can be easily resolved. We are setting out the ground rules about how any savings can be re-deployed into developing better services.

We will actively support those practices and PCTs who want to take advantage of the possibilities that practice led commissioning provides. Early in the New Year we will be offering support to the NHS in the form of further technical guidance and IT support, which I think will be essential. This will give practices the tools they need in order to take the fullest advantage of these new opportunities. The rest will be down to you.
