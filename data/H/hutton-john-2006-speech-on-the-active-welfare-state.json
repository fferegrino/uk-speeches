        "In particular, the legacy of Thatcher\u2019s Britain was one of passive benefit dependency as a means of managing industrial decline. In a world where discrimination already scarred the lives of many disabled people and older workers \u2013 we saw millions of people written off onto benefit \u2013 with no expectation of a return to work. While Britain got steadily healthier as a nation, the numbers on Incapacity Benefit trebled between 1979 and 1997. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits rose by 50 per cent whilst the number claiming lone parent and incapacity benefits more than trebled.

By the late 2020s, nearly half of the adult population will be over 50. Over the next forty years or so, the numbers of pensioners will increase by 50%. Originally there were ten people of working age for every pensioner. Now there are four for every one pensioner; By 2050, two of working age for every one in retirement.
