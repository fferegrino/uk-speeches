        "To anyone expecting me to \u2018name and shame\u2019 those responsible for using illicit diamonds to fuel wars in Africa, I am sorry to disappoint you. Today I come not to \u2018name and shame\u2019 but to \u2018name and praise\u2019.

        "To praise Antwerp\u2019s leading diamond banks: ABN-AMRO, the Antwerp Diamond bank and Artesia Bank for deciding to terminate relations with any client dealing in \u2018conflict diamonds\u2019.

        "Firstly, expulsion from a manufacturing association, or diamond bourse, has little meaning if you can carry on trading regardless. I think the industry needs to decide that only licensed manufacturers and dealers can trade.

        "I suggest you also need to benchmark clear minimum standards and encourage best practice. On the latter, I am encouraged by the move of companies, such as De Beers, to make affirmative statements on all sales invoices that they are not dealing in \u2018conflict diamonds\u2019. If we can get meaningful controls in place to allow only certified roughs into the leading and bona fide diamond trading centres which you represent, consumers will surely demand that the trade gives them confidence through a voluntary \u2018chain of warranties\u2019.
