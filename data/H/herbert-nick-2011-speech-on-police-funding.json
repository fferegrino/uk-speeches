        "It has been argued that the distribution of grant between forces is unfair. We looked closely at whether it would be right or possible to adjust the grant reduction to take into account the fact that some forces raise less from their precept than others, but there were a number of objections to that. One is that by doing so, we would be penalising council tax payers in other areas who already pay far more for their policing services and have had a big increase in council tax over previous years. That would certainly be unfair. And by subsidising forces \u2013 including large forces with greater capacity \u2013 in that way, we would be asking others to take a larger cut in central grant than 20 per cent. They would have regarded that as unfair, too. The fair solution, and the one expected by forces and authorities, was to treat all forces in the same way with an equal cut in grant.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team",
        "Of course there has been much focus on the expectation that police officer numbers and staff numbers will fall. But as I have consistently argued, this is a narrow focus.

        "Some have said that the funding settlement is not manageable \u2013 or that the profile of the reductions makes it harder. But the overall settlement is just that \u2013 settled. Neither the 20 per cent real reduction in government grant nor the profile are negotiable. In cash terms \u2013 not taking into account inflation \u2013 the average reduction for forces\u2019 grant is 4 per cent in the first year, five per cent in the second, 2 per cent in the third and 1 per cent in the fourth. That doesn\u2019t affect the council tax funding for forces, which is determined locally, and which on average accounts for a quarter of all police funding.
