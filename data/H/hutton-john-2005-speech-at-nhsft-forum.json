Our national expectations, both as consumers and taxpayers are higher today then they\u2019ve ever been before. Rightly so. We know how important good health is to the quality of our lives and those of our families. We expect a more personal service.

More doctors and nurses than ever before are helping us to realise these improvements in the standards of care that we provide.
