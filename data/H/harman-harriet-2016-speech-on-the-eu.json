        "Your work is important to this sector and I know that it\u2019s also important to you and your family. The fact of the matter is that there are few households, and no regions and no sectors which could manage without women\u2019s work. Our work is vital to household budgets and to our economy. The workforce is now women and men. But despite that we are still not equal at work or at home. We\u2019ve made great strides at work, and you can see that with women\u2019s earning power increasing. But the higher up you get in any workplace the fewer women there are. And there is still not equal sharing of family responsibilities \u2013 whether it be for bringing up children or caring for the elderly or disabled.

        "This is a huge, and quite recent change. When I first started work there was no right to equal pay \u2013 job adverts showed the woman\u2019s rate and the man\u2019s rate for the same job. Employers could and did advertise jobs for men, which women couldn\u2019t apply for. And when you got pregnant you usually kept it secret to try and keep your job for as long as possible. When you left work to have a baby your job went. You had to apply to go back to work like a new employee \u2013 even to your old job.

        "The rights that we now have at work did not just arrive out of thin air. They came from a combination of what our governments have done and what the EU has made them do. I would rather we got all of our rights from our own government. Half the population are women and we are a democracy \u2013 it doesn\u2019t seem too much to ask for our own government to back us up. It feels odd to get legal rights handed to us from Brussels rather than from Westminster. But if it\u2019s a case of having them coming from Brussels or not at all, let\u2019s not be in any doubt that wherever they come from, these rights are essential for women\u2019s progress in their lives. No government likes a Directive \u2013 let alone from abroad \u2013 telling them what to do or a Court \u2013 and God forbid a foreign court \u2013 forcing them to make changes. But EU Directives and European Court judgments have been making our government back women up at work.

        "Every time any new right for women has been introduced, whether it\u2019s come from Westminster, our courts, or Brussels \u2013 it\u2019s been bitterly opposed. There was opposition to the Equal Pay and the Sex Discrimination Acts. The Tories voted against the Equality Act as recently as 2010. In the past, even unions opposed equal rights for their part-timer women members. The CBI and the Chambers of Commerce oppose new rights. Even the Labour government which I was part of complained about European Court of Justice rulings on women\u2019s rights. It\u2019s naive to suppose that everyone now suddenly agrees with them. Women\u2019s rights are in the firing line whenever there\u2019s a call for deregulation or \u201ccutting red tape\u201d. Bright ideas pop up to give businesses \u201cgreater freedom\u201d in this sector or that region. Right now, though few will say they oppose women\u2019s rights, given half the chance, the covert hostility to these rights would soon rear its ugly head. They argue that it\u2019s about saving government money or cutting red tape on business, but women\u2019s rights would be sacrificed.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team",
