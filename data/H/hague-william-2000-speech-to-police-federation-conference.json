        "You know, and I know, that this crisis is not your fault. Each day you go out on to the streets and do your job to the very best of your professional ability. And what a job it is. When I was preparing this speech, I looked at the list of officers who had won Police Bravery Awards.

        "This liberal thinking on crime, which has pervaded our criminal justice system for forty years, has comprehensively failed Britain.
