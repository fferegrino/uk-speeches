        "Less than two weeks ago, we saw our relationship with our biggest and closest trading partner, five decades after a Tory Government took us into the European Economic Community in a 12-year process, fizzle out in another of these constrained debates\u2014so much for the sovereignty of Parliament.

        "On international aid, Cameron, Brown, Blair, Major and even the last Prime Minister\u2014every living Prime Minister \u2014have condemned the cutting of the 0.7% contribution to the world\u2019s poorest as morally unjustifiable and practically short-sighted, particularly at a time when the world faces the common enemy of coronavirus.
