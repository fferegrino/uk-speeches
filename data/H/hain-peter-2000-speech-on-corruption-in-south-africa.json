        "This is not simply a moral imperative. The new factor is globalisation. Modern communications mean it is less easy to cover up.

It is difficult to quantify, although in Eastern Europe this is an extra 10 per cent tax on business according to the World Bank and EBRD.

        "Corruption is the abuse of a position for private gain. We can draw a distinction between petty corruption and what George Moody Stuart calls \u2018grand corruption\u2019. Clearly it is right to start tackling the problem at the top with the big fish. But ultimately the aim must be to change cultures where petty corruption is viewed as normal. The causes of corruption are complex. Certain economic policies can inadvertently promote corruption. Foreign exchange or import controls often encourage corruption. There are obvious risks attached to uncontrolled deregulation as well. Too much economic power in the hands of political elites is undesirable. Africa\u2019s leaders must shoulder some of the responsibility; Western Governments must hold their hands up and accept their share of the blame too.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents",

        "Corruption is a global issue. Corruption in Southern Africa often involves participation by foreign entities, including major corporations and individuals seeking contracts and business opportunities.

        "The UK is working with its partners in the IMF, World Bank and other multilateral and bilateral aid agencies to encourage them to use their influence to promote anti-corruption systems in the countries where they are working, particularly in Southern Africa. It is important that clear guidelines for promoting good governance, such as those developed by the IMF in 1998, are replicated by all organisations, including NGOs, procurement agents and other service delivery participants. Country assistance programmes and strategies should take into account and promote anti-corruption strategies at the national level. Particular attention should be paid to the level of transparency and accountability in government decision-making. There are a number of international initiatives to tackle corruption. Apart from the OECD\u2019s Bribery Convention, there are also the Council of Europe\u2019s Criminal and Civil Law Conventions on Corruption covering active and passive bribery of domestic and foreign public and private sector officials, including judges and members of public assemblies. I hope that Southern African countries will consider introducing similar provisions in their own legislation which explicitly criminalise corruption.

        "But Africa can still turn itself around. If it can tackle the central problems of governance, then globalisation offers unlimited scope for attracting investment and beginning the process of catching up with the Asian Tiger economies and establishing its own successful Lion economies. The global growth in information and communication technologies will force governments to become more transparent, helping cut out corruption. As we have seen in the last two months in Zimbabwe, growing use of the internet by the Opposition MDC has helped lead to a more open, inclusive society, with stronger institutions, and a greater voice for civil society. IT can improve information flows to foreign investors. New technology (for example mobile telephones and solar panels) may provide ways round traditional obstacles to growth.
