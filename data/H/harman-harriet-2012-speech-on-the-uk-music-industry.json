Last week I was in Manchester \u2013 with its massive music tradition and now with the new BBC media centre in Salford. Historically Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow have had a massive impact on music. And music has been a key part of economic regeneration in the regions too. The abolition of the Regional Development Agencies \u2013 which helped draw in investment and stimulate growth in our regions \u2013 including from European funds to our regions \u2013 hasn\u2019t helped. Their replacements, the new regional growth funds, in their current form, are not adequate and this must be addressed. There has to be a proper regional strategy for growth in the music industry.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team",

        "Let me give you and example. Music producer Steve Levine took out a bank loan to produce and distribute singer Natalie McCool\u2019s first album. He released her single on iTunes for 99p per download. The week the single was released a website Freedownloadsong.com offered it for free. Her fans believed this to be legitimate and nearly 7,000 downloaded her song. Had Steve been able to sell these songs at 99p per track he would have been able to pay Natalie and the bank loan. The bank accused Steve of giving them inaccurate sales projections and demanded their money back.
