        "I very much welcome the commitment of the CBI to engage in the debate about public service reform. For many years business organisations in the UK were not always fully involved in the debate about how we improve the quality of our public services. That has now changed. Businesses use and fund public services. Education, transport and health systems make a critical difference to the competitiveness of the UK economy. And increasingly you are part of the solution \u2013 partnering with the public sector in the delivery of those services. The creation of the CBI\u2019s Public Services Strategy Board and this Public Services Forum reflects the tremendous growth of this new industry and a commitment on behalf of business in engaging fully in that debate.

This has been perhaps the most controversial and difficult of our reforms. Opening up monopoly state provision to private and voluntary sector providers. In the early days we believed that structural change was a distraction from raising educational standards or healthcare. Eventually we came to understand that structural change and incentives also have an important role to play in raising standards; that you simply could not have one without the other.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework",
