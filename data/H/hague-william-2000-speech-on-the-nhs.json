        "I absolutely agree. Patient\u2019s choice should be at the heart of the National Plan. The right of GPs to refer patients to the hospital of their choice should be restored in practice and not just in theory. This was in effect abolished by the Labour Government last year, a decision which the President of the Royal College of Surgeons described as \u2018not right for the highest standards of patient care\u2019. To ensure GPs and patients can make an informed choice, they should have free access to information on things like waiting times and treatment success rates in different hospitals. And, crucially, hospitals would then be paid for the operations they carry out. For that is the way that patients choice will drive up standards across the National Health Service. Good hospitals will then attract more patients and more funding, while bad hospitals will have a real incentive to improve their services.
