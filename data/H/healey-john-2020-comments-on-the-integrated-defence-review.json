        "The PM promises a welcome and long overdue upgrade to Britain\u2019s defences after a decade of decline since 2010. He is right to \u2018end an era of retreat\u2019 after the last two defence reviews have been a cover to cut defence spending by \u00a38 billion and the size of the Armed Forces by 40,000 full time troops.

        "The MoD\u2019s challenge now is delivery, delivery, delivery. Ministers must make sure they put the new money to best use and avoid the mistakes of the past.
