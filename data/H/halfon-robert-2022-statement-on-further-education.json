The decision to reclassify the FE sector will not alter these strategic aims. Colleges will continue to play a leadership role in England\u2019s skills system.

        "My officials said at the start of the review that we wanted to ensure that if colleges were reclassified, it happened in as seamless a way as possible, maintaining continuity and stability for the sector where possible. We have taken the time to get these changes right; to give colleges the support that they need as the transition takes place; and to explore the ways that colleges, learners, employers and communities might all make the most of this change.

        "\u201cManaging Public Money\u201d is clear that public sector organisations may borrow from private sector sources only if the transaction delivers better value for money for the Exchequer.
