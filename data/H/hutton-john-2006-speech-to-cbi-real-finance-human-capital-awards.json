But it\u2019s clear that our future success will hinge not simply on getting people into work \u2013 it will depend on supporting them to stay there. In today\u2019s labour market, the typical worker changes jobs seven times during a working life. We need to make sure that our welfare delivery system doesn\u2019t pull up the drawbridge of support too quickly. Too often we think the job is done as soon as someone has entered the labour market. But helping individuals to acquire the skills, confidence and ambition to progress through the workplace has to be a core ambition of a dynamic welfare system. This is the new challenge.

        "Second, the creation of a more responsive and integrated system of skills and employment support must be based on a more dynamic market in the provision of skills. We cannot expect business in our economy to compete effectively in ever-more intense domestic, European and global markets, if the market for skills provision is not dynamic and competitive. And it is clear from Sandy Leitch\u2019s first report, that with only 2% of discretionary employer skills spending going to FE colleges, the Government was right to publish its recent White Paper on raising skills in Further Education \u2013 which set out the role of further education, its economic mission and the need to be much more responsive to both employers and individuals.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework",
