        "So we should remain focused on improving the quality of publicly funded services and be prepared to change things that aren\u2019t working.

They don\u2019t need revising or changing. But they do have to be combined with a new discipline that offers the consumer the best service; and the taxpayer the best value for money in today\u2019s rapidly changing world.
