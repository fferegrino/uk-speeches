        "But the Welfare Reform Green Paper was about more than changes to individual benefits. At its heart was the vision of a modern active devolved welfare state, based on a new contract between the State and the individual. A contract that extends support and opportunity in exchange for engagement and responsibility. A contract that lifts the summit of our ambition beyond simply getting people back into work to one that seeks to sustain their careers and progress up the job ladder. And a new contract between State and communities to share the challenge of tackling worklessness and poverty in Britain.
