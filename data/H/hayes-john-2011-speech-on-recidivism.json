        "This speech is about recidivism. It\u2019s about the frightening fact that 39 per cent of offenders re-offend. Countless extra crimes in every part of Britain. It\u2019s about the \u00a313 billion a year that costs the community. It\u2019s about the broken lives of the parents, wives and children of those who go on breaking the law. And it\u2019s about all the extra victims of those crimes.
