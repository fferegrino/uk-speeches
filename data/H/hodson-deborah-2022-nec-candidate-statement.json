        "Deborah is a socialist African Caribbean woman, trade unionist and long-standing activist in the Camberwell and Peckham CLP and nationally in the labour movement. For more than a decade, she has campaigned for the Labour Party.

        "Black women are among the most deprived people in society and the most badly affected by the Tory government\u2019s devastating policy of austerity and cuts and should therefore be in the forefront of the working-class fight-back. As an NEC member Deborah would fight for and be accountable to Labour members who need a strong voice at this crucial time for our party. She believes that the racism and attacks on Black communities in the UK that have resulted in the Grenfell fire tragedy, the Windrush scandal and continuing police brutality against Black men that reignited the Black Lives Matter movement, demand strong Black advocates in the Labour Party and wider labour movement. Deborah would oppose unfair disciplinary action against members and promote the value of natural justice.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team",
