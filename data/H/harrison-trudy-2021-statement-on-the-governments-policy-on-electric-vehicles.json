The approach has worked\u2014it has helped to kick-start a market that is now moving forward at pace. Over 150,000 zero emission cars have been sold so far this year, more than one in 10 of all new cars sold. Electric van uptake is also accelerating at pace, with grant orders up 250% this year compared with 2020.

Small vans will also receive \u00a32,500, and large vans \u00a35,000, with a per financial year limit of 1,000 grants per business to ensure that funding is spread fairly. There will be no changes for small or large trucks, which receive \u00a316,000 and \u00a325,000 respectively. Motorcycles priced up to \u00a310,000 (L3e category) will receive \u00a3500 and mopeds (L1e) will get \u00a3150.
