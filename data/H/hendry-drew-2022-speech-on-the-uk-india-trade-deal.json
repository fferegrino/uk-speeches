Tariffs on Scotch whisky going to India are currently 150%. I will therefore watch closely his approach to the deal. Our successful removal of the Airbus-Boeing tariffs has hugely benefited the Scotch whisky industry. I am not sure whether the hon.

They did not even support the trade deal between the EU and Ukraine. They also abstained on the Japan and Singapore deals.
