        "I rise, on behalf of all the constituents of Wimbledon, Morden, Raynes Park and Motspur Park, to pay tribute to our beloved monarch and all that she has done. I also want to express, on their behalf, our sincere condolences to King Charles III and the whole royal family on the loss that they have suffered.

        "As has already been said by many colleagues, including my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove (Mr Wragg), her reign has transcended times of turbulence and times of gloom. It has transcended the mass usage of automobiles, telephones, jet travel and the digital age. Surely, as we mourn today, we reflect on the fact that it was her steadfast commitment to duty, to loyalty, and to our country and our people that helped us not only to overcome and embrace those changes, but shape\u2014in a way that we now see is so much for the better\u2014this country we live in, modern Britain.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents",
        "Many people, as I go around Wimbledon, tell me that they are grateful for the visits she made to my constituency. Much has been said about the fact that she was a fan of horseracing. In the diamond jubilee year, she came to the All England to watch tennis. That was not exactly the Queen\u2019s favourite sport; she had not been for 25 years. She watched the game, and after she had left I said to one of the members of the committee, \u201cWell, that went well!\u201d He said, \u201cShe was charming; it was wonderful.\u201d I said, \u201cShe even appeared to be interested in tennis.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, she did ask to know the result of the 4.20 at Ascot.\u201d\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents",
