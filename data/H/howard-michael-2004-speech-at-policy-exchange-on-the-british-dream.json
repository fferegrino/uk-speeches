Too many are disenchanted with politics and government. Too many are cheated of the decent education that is essential for people to make the best of their lives. Too many are cheated of the first class healthcare that they deserve. Why? Because we have a State that does too much, that interferes too much, that is too unaccountable.

Cheap flights enable more of us to go abroad more often; almost everyone now has a mobile phone and soon, no doubt, will have a video phone.
