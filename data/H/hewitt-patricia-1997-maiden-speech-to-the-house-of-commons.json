It has been a pleasure to listen to such fine maiden speeches this afternoon. I listened with interest to the speech of the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Mr. Norman). Having spent many a pleasant weekend with friends in his constituency, I was sorry to hear that \u201cDisgusted of Tunbridge Wells\u201d remains disgusted.

Greville\u2019s father, who subsequently became Lord Janner, did not announce his decision to retire until after the 1970 general election had been called. Greville used to tell the story of his selection with great amusement. He claimed\u2014I am sure quite wrongly\u2014that he was assisted by the fact that the election posters, \u201cVote Labour, Vote Janner\u201d, had already been printed.
