        "This is a decisive moment for the future of primary care in the NHS. Last year we saw agreement on the new contracts for GPs and the first tranche of new investment to go in alongside it. Next year we will see the introduction of the new practice based commissioning arrangements. Both of these changes have the potential to fundamentally change the quality, capability and capacity of primary care services. We need to take full advantage of these opportunities if we are to maximise the benefits of both.

        "The NHS was built on the foundations of primary care and primary care remains central to its future. Nearly all of our patients begin and end their treatment in a GPs surgery. Primary care continues to enjoy the highest satisfaction rates of any part of the National Health Service. It has a proud record in public health and health promotion. And despite all of its detractors, NHS primary care is still the envy of every other developed health care system and a model admired right across the world. If primary care is the cornerstone of the NHS then it is clear that the ambitions we have for the NHS can never be fully realised unless primary care has the tools to do its job properly.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework",

        "There are more GPs and nurses working in primary care than at any time in the history of the NHS. More doctors than ever before want to work in general practice.

        "So we\u2019ve come a long way. But clearly not everything is perfect. Not every part of primary care in our country has seen all of these improvements. The pressures are still there and they are experienced every day by hundreds of dedicated staff and thousands of increasingly frustrated patients. So it is not my argument today that every problem in primary care has been solved. We all know that isn\u2019t true. Nor am I saying that primary care cannot improve further still, because we all know that it can. My argument today is that primary care has an extraordinary opportunity to build for the future.

In North Bradford PCT, which has been using Practice Based Commissioning for 4 years, waiting times are well below six months. And Practice Based Commissioning will give GPs and their patients greater choice in how services are provided and should lead to more varied and more local services. For instance, East Devon PCT has used Practice Based Commissioning to reduce reliance on secondary care. Patients that would have gone to the Royal Devon & Exeter Hospital for Ear Nose and Throat complaints are now being treated in a primary care setting by practitioners with special interests.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework",

        "Practice Based Commissioning is part of a journey to improve the NHS and make it the service we all want it to be. Focused absolutely on the needs of patients. On managing referrals into secondary care efficiently and effectively. On providing services in the most appropriate setting possible and as close to the patient as we can. That journey is not over yet. We still have a great deal to do. But even our most sternest critics would, I think, be prepared to acknowledge that there are now real and tangible signs of progress right across the country. Shorter waiting times. Reduced mortality from cancer and coronary heart disease. Newer hospitals and better GP premises. Faster access to the latest drugs, treatments and equipment that can help us improve our ability to diagnose and cure our patients.
