        "The relationship between the State and the individual lies at the heart of the pensions debate. This relationship is so important because the state pension system reflects one aspect of a much wider social contract. A contract that binds our country and our communities together, based on the notion that risk should be pooled, that all should contribute according to their means, and that the there is a floor below which no person should be allowed to fall. Our ability to build a lasting pensions settlement hinges crucially on whether we can establish clear roles and clear expectations for that relationship within a rapidly changing world, and which reflects these fundamental values of solidarity and social cohesion.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework",

        "The Government welcomed the broad framework of the Pensions Commission proposals and options. The idea of a stronger State Pension funded by some increase in the state pension age and acting as a platform on which to build a radical expansion in personal saving through access to new and low cost savings options \u2013 is absolutely the right basis for the debate. It defines the 2 key roles of the State in this new deal with the individual. Firstly as a provider \u2013 funding a minimum income below which no-one is allowed to fall and providing a proper platform on which to build private savings.
