        "Yes, I do. I\u2019ve worked all my political life to tackle discrimination and to support diversity. And the problem is that  \nthe virus doesn\u2019t discriminate.

And the problem therefore is that \u2013 I just wish people \u2013 I really hope people make the argument, and I will support them in making that argument. I hope that they will make that case stronger. But please don\u2019t gather in groups of more than six, because in groups of more than six that risks spreading the virus and that risks lives.
