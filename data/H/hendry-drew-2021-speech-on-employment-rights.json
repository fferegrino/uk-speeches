        "Workers deserve our thanks, our respect and our appreciation. Scotland should not have to protect hard-fought workers\u2019 rights from the Tories and their Brexit chaos. By reneging on their promise to protect EU-derived workers\u2019 rights, the UK Government would again prove that it is impossible to trust anything the Tories say, especially on Brexit. The SNP is clear that it rejects any regression of workers\u2019 protections. However, the Scottish Government\u2019s ability to tackle unfair working practices and to fully protect workers\u2019 rights remains limited.
