    "content": [
        "I am actually almost speechless that he\u2019s our MP. It\u2019s a large constituency, it\u2019s got its own problems like every other constituency and he should be here looking after them quite frankly. I don\u2019t know how much they get paid for doing it [appearing on I\u2019m a Celebrity], but it would appear that as the Prime Minister blanked him when he was getting the validation from the faithful that he thought _\u2018I might as well take the money\u2019_. If he\u2019s the person you\u2019ve got to look up to as an MP, he\u2019s a damn awful role model. He\u2019s letting his colleagues down throughout Parliament, it doesn\u2019t matter which party you belong to, if this is what people think of their representative and how they behave. It\u2019s not just what he did as a Minister of the Crown, there was a massive amount of hypocrisy telling us what to do whilst he was doing completely the opposite. He resigned eventually as the Health Minister, but no way was he going to resign as the MP, and in various guises, he\u2019s a Mr Action Men, swimming in the Serpentine and other stunts.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team"
