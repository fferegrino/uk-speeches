It passed Report and Third Reading on Monday, and was introduced into the House of Lords on 13 December.

        "I would like to correct the hon. Gentleman. We are progressing at pace, and we are having conversations with the devolved Administrations\u2014indeed, I had conversations with Ministers from Wales and Scotland recently. Overall, enthusiasm for the deals is considerable right across the UK.

That will bring huge benefits right across the country, and all nations of the UK will benefit from a 53% and 59% boost to bilateral trade through the Australia and New Zealand deals respectively.
