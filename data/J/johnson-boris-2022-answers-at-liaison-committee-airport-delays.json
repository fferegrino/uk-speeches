But Gatwick, for example, has controlled the number of flights that will be able to fly out during July and August, because they can see the airlines are trying to fly at 2018 levels. They could see the number of staff coming on, so they have taken action. Other airports haven\u2019t necessarily. The regulator\u2014the Civil Aviation Authority\u2014doesn\u2019t have the power, up front, to implement these types of policies.
