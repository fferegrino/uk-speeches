        "The inquiry\u2019s report was clear that the use of aluminium composite material (ACM) rainscreen cladding and combustible insulation on the exterior of the tower was the defining factor in the rapid spread of the fire. The Government introduced regulations in December 2018 that banned the use of combustible materials in and on the external walls of specific types of new high-rise buildings. A public consultation was held between January and May 2020, to further explore and refine the scope \u200bof that ban, including a proposal to ban the use of ACM with unmodified polyethylene core and similar materials on all buildings in England.
