        "And that is why we are so concerned by the Delta variant that is now spreading faster than the third wave predicted in the February roadmap. We\u2019re seeing cases growing by about 64 per cent per week, and in the worst affected areas, it\u2019s doubling every week. And the average number of people being admitted to hospital in England has increased by 50 per cent week on week, and by 61 per cent in the North West, which may be the shape of things to come.

And to give the NHS that extra time we will hold off step 4 openings until July 19th except for weddings that can still go ahead with more than 30 guests provided social distancing remains in place and the same will apply to wakes. And we will continue the pilot events \u2013 such as Euro2020 and some theatrical performances.
