        "Yes, absolutely they should in the areas where schools are open. What we\u2019re doing, clearly, is grappling with a new variant of the virus which is surging particularly in London and the south east, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve had to take exceptional measures for some parts to close primary schools, keep primary schools closed temporarily. Not something anybody wants to do. We\u2019ve really fought very hard throughout this pandemic across the country to keep schools open. There are lots of reasons for that. Schools are safe. Very, very important to stress that and that the threats, the risk to kids, to young people is really very, very, very small. Indeed, as the scientists continually attest, the risk to staff is very small. But of course the benefits of education are so huge, overwhelmingly we want to keep our young people, keep children in education because that\u2019s the best thing for them. So that\u2019s why we\u2019ve worked so hard to do it. So I\u2019d advise all parents thinking about what to do, look at where your area is: overwhelmingly you\u2019ll be in a part of the country where primary schools tomorrow will be open.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings",

If you think about what they did in the north west \u2013 and yet \u2013 well, the evidence actually is that they were able to do that and to get the virus under control.

        "The second thing is that we are going to be ramping up testing across the whole of the system. I don\u2019t think people have focused enough on this, if I may just for a second, one of the things we didn\u2019t have when we went into the first lockdown, where we sadly did have to close schools, was we didn\u2019t have this huge number of lateral flow tests. We now have tens, hundreds of millions of lateral flow tests, which I believe and hope can be used, deployed, particularly in secondary schools to assist the return of schools. And it\u2019s not that the return will be safe \u2013 the schools are safe \u2013 the issue is how can you stop schools being places where the virus can circulate and then spread into all the other households?
