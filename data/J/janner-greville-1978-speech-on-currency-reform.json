        "As the value of our currency declines, so inevitably does the value of the pound note and of each of the coins that represent that value in the hands, in the pockets and in the wallets of the ordinary user. I am happy to have this opportunity to ask the House to consider whether the time has now come for a complete review of our coins and our notes in the light of the decline in the value of money, in the light of inflation, and in the light of the weight of the coins that exist. In particular, I shall suggest that the time has arrived for the introduction of a \u00a31 coin, for the introduction of a crown\u2014that is, a 25p coin\u2014and for a change in the type, size and, in particular, in the weight of the coins that are used at present.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework",
        "The value of currency has dropped in the last 20 years by four times. That is to say, \u00a31 in 1957 would have bought as much as \u00a34 today, 20 years later. Yet we still do not have a coin to represent the 1978 value of a 1957 pound. Indeed, the speed at which the value of the pound has dropped has increased, as we all know. Since decimalisation, when the last major changes in our currency took place, on 15th February 1971, there has been a drop in value of just under 60 per cent. Yet this drop is in no way reflected in the coins and in the notes that are in current use.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework",
        "It is clear, therefore, that a review is necessary and that steps ought reasonably to be taken so that people can have coins and notes that are convenient to handle, light in weight, last a reasonable time in the wallet or in the pocket, do not deteriorate so fast, and are easily recognisable by those who use them.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework",
        "I deal first with the question of the \u00a31 coin. The Financial Times today carries a splendid cartoon suggesting that I should let nature take its course and the pound note will disappear anyway. If we allow it to go on long enough, I dare say that that will be so. In spite of the tremendous reduction in the inflation rate from nearly 30 per cent. about three \u200b or four years ago to under 10 per cent. today, the pound still faces a change which is inevitable and which is continuing along with the world financial situation.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework",
        "What we now need is a coin which is convenient in use and which will last indefinitely. I am informed in answer to a Question that the average life of a \u00a31 note today is 10 months, the life of a \u00a35 note, which is used less, is 18 months, the life of a \u00a310 note is two years and the life of a \u00a320 note\u2014which I do not think that some of us have ever seen\u2014is two and a half years. A coin would be expected to have a life of at least 25 years. Therefore, even if the introduction of a coin were expensive at first, it would certainly be justified and much cheaper in the long run.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework",
        "Given that it would be possible to produce coins, the question then would be whether this introduction would mean the end of the pound note. Here I draw the attention of the House to the fact that in many other countries both coins and notes exist in the same denominations without causing any difficulty, so that those who prefer to use coins can handle coins and those who prefer to handle notes can handle notes. In France, for example, there are 50 franc and 10 franc notes and coins. As the value of the pound in France is about 9 francs, this means that the French have the equivalent of a \u00a31 and a \u00a35 coin, although the latter is not in common use.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework",
