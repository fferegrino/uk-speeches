The figures for crimes of violence against the person\u2014homicide, attempted murder and serious wounding\u2014have nearly doubled in the past 10 years. What has caused most anxiety has been the level of violence among young people. There is no way of knowing how much violent crime young people commit. All we have are the figures of those cautioned or found guilty in the courts. The figures for 1974 show that 49,879 were found guilty or cautioned for crimes of violence.

        "To a large extent, the old rules have gone and the power of the Church has diminished, as has some of our traditional tolerance. We do not appear to know how or with what to replace them. We do not know how to reconcile the need for an orderly society with our need for a wider freedom or how to have discipline and regulation without unfeeling authoritarianism. Perhaps that is why parents and teachers find it so difficult to discharge their duties and why so many children, growing up in an unsure and ill-defined framework of rules and regulations, regard them as arbitrary and too dependent on whim.  \nTherefore, the ties of family have become weaker, families are smaller and fewer families have had the experience of their Victorian ancestors where the older children first learnt the art of rearing children by looking after their younger brothers and sisters.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings",

The findings of an investigation known as \u201cDelinquency: its roots, careers and prospects\u201d provide some hope. The first step is to help people in poverty. It is better to spend money supporting those families than to spend even larger sums employing social workers after the damage has been done. I hope that that is what the reform of our welfare services, promised by the Government, will achieve.

        "To judge from comments that are being made, it is possible that the public and the broadcasting organisations are getting our of step, in which case it would be helpful for the BBC and IBA to explain in greater detail to the public their policy towards violence. They might provide examples of when they think it appropriate to apply the code or guidelines to producers and when not to apply it. They could say whether they are contemplating revising their practices and, if not, why not.

        "There is another reason why it would be in the interests of British broadcasting to set a lead and take the public into its confidence. We are on the brink of an expansion in the number of television channels we can receive. Not all of even the English language programmes will be in British ownership or transmitted by British companies. There is a distinct risk that more will not mean better, that more will not lead to more choice, and that standards will fall. Standards cannot always be upheld by popular choice in the market place. As with many things in life, the people may not have a will to uphold decent and fair standards.
