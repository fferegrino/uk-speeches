When some people said we should go back into lockdown \u2013 we made the tough choice to open up last July \u2013 when I think that the Labour Party said we were being reckless. Never forget, if we\u2019d listened to Captain Hindsight and the Labour Party \u2013 I never tire I\u2019m telling you this, but it\u2019s true \u2013 we would still be in lockdown and we would certainly not be seeing the strong growth and employment that we\u2019re seeing today. When the Labour Party and the current leader were trying with might and main to install a leader who wanted \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m serious \u2013 to abolish NATO, we were already training Ukrainian troops to fight. And it\u2019s an absolutely incredible fact and it\u2019s true \u2013 a t a time when Russia is being led by a President who is capable of bullying and threats, who\u2019s plainly capable of making dangerous and irrational decisions \u2013 we have a Labour party whose shadow cabinet is stuffed with people who only recently voted to abolish the UK\u2019s independent nuclear deterrent. That\u2019s right. Eight of them. The Shadow Foreign Secretary \u2013 unbelievable \u2013 the Shadow Levelling-up Secretary, the Shadow Transport Secretary, I can\u2019t get the entire list, but you can find it out. That\u2019s them.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings",
        "Do we want them in charge, my friends at this moment? Do we want them running up the white flag? Do you see them standing up to Putin\u2019s blackmail? By the way, in the next few weeks: Do we want them running our councils where we know that up and down the country Labour councils cost you more and Conservatives deliver better services? Do we want them in charge of the economy of this amazing country of ours when there has never been a Labour government that left with unemployment lower than when they arrived? Let me tell you when you go out campaigning in the \u2013 in the \u2013 next few weeks, as we all will, joyfully. Let me tell you that my message to everybody on the doorstep is that it is Conservatives \u2013 it\u2019s Conservatives \u2013 who get things done, even when they look difficult, and it\u2019s Conservatives who take the tough decisions to help you, to be on your side, to help you with the cost of living. And it\u2019s Conservatives who stand up for freedom against the blackmail of Vladimir Putin.
