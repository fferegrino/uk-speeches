        "Police officers tell me that they cannot do their job effectively. They joined the police to fight crime and catch criminals \u2013 and that is what the public want them to do. Instead, they spend hour upon hour filling in forms \u2013 and judging from letters to Police Review and surveys of individual forces, the police believe that most of the bureaucracy is unnecessary. The result is rock bottom morale, which the Chairman of the Police Federation says is the worst he has ever seen.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations\n  *[Ofcom]: Office of Communications\n  *[COLT]: City Of London Telecom\n  *[4G]: fourth generation mobile network\n  *[5G]: fifth generation mobile network\n  *[DSIT]: Department for Science, Innovation and Technology\n  *[Defra]: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\n  *[2G]: second generation mobile network\n  *[3G]: third generation mobile network\n  *[6G]: sixth generation mobile network\n  *[ITU]: International Telecommunication Union\n  *[R&D]: research and development\n  *[OpenRAN]: Open Radio Access Networks\n  *[ONE]: Open Network Ecosystem",

        "Forces up and down the country complain of being overwhelmed by the bureaucracy of the Best Value system introduced by this Government. To give you an idea of the order of magnitude, the Chief Constable of Lincolnshire has estimated that it costs \u00a3400,000, and in Norfolk \u00a3200,000. Today, I can announce that we will review Best Value with the aim of radically reforming, or, if necessary, abolishing the current exercise. No wonder a Chief Constable claims that forces are \u2018sinking under a sea of targets and measures\u2019. There are dozens of performance indicators from Best Value alone, before any others are taken into account.
