        "The idea that children should not go hungry is one that most people would consider an issue of basic morality. I am glad that the Government have now conceded that the free school meals scheme should be extended to cover the summer, but given that the Under-Secretary of State for Education, the hon. Member for Chelmsford (Vicky Ford) was still arguing against this only a few hours ago, it is clear that this is not a moral change of heart, but a result of incredible pressure from campaigners such as Marcus Rashford and the Opposition.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations\n  *[Ofcom]: Office of Communications\n  *[COLT]: City Of London Telecom\n  *[4G]: fourth generation mobile network\n  *[5G]: fifth generation mobile network\n  *[DSIT]: Department for Science, Innovation and Technology\n  *[Defra]: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\n  *[2G]: second generation mobile network\n  *[3G]: third generation mobile network\n  *[6G]: sixth generation mobile network\n  *[ITU]: International Telecommunication Union\n  *[R&D]: research and development\n  *[OpenRAN]: Open Radio Access Networks\n  *[ONE]: Open Network Ecosystem",
        "I would like to ask the Minister about one aspect of the policy. There are many children in this country who have committed no crime but the crime of being migrants \u2014an accident of geography\u2014and who therefore have no recourse to public funds.

        "It is telling that the Education Secretary should imply that children need access to nutritious, healthy meals only when they are at school.

        "Despite the very welcome U-turn, this Government are by no means let off the hook for their shameful and damning record on child poverty and hunger. In the sixth richest country in the world, there is no excuse for letting a single child go to bed hungry. The fact that 1.3 million children are routinely receiving free school meals shows that something is deeply wrong. We are a wealthy country, but that wealth is not fairly distributed; the wealthiest 10% in our country have about 45% of the wealth. That inequality is only increasing; wages for the majority have been stagnant for the past decade, employment is increasingly insecure and precarious, and we have a standard-of-living slide, all while the rich get richer.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations\n  *[Ofcom]: Office of Communications\n  *[COLT]: City Of London Telecom\n  *[4G]: fourth generation mobile network\n  *[5G]: fifth generation mobile network\n  *[DSIT]: Department for Science, Innovation and Technology\n  *[Defra]: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\n  *[2G]: second generation mobile network\n  *[3G]: third generation mobile network\n  *[6G]: sixth generation mobile network\n  *[ITU]: International Telecommunication Union\n  *[R&D]: research and development\n  *[OpenRAN]: Open Radio Access Networks\n  *[ONE]: Open Network Ecosystem",
        "Even though they may be fed this summer, we will still have approximately one third of children living in poverty.
