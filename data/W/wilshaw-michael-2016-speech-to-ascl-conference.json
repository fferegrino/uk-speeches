Nevertheless, all these things have an upside because it reassured the doubters that I really do have a heart. Indeed, I have a very big heart for our education service and particularly for the great work that you do as headteachers. That\u2019s not just an idle platitude at the start of a speech, but a deeply felt belief in the power of headship to change young people\u2019s lives for the better.
