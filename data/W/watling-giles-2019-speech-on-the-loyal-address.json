        "When walking in Clacton, I gained support from many previous Labour voters; there were people who had voted Labour all their lives, as had their parents and grandparents, yet this time they gave me their vote.

        "During the election, I stood on doorsteps in Clacton with a simple message: \u201cWe must get Brexit done and then focus on other vital priorities, including even more police, better healthcare and infrastructure improvements, not to mention education.\u201d Predominantly, the response I got back was the same. People said, \u201cYes, those are our priorities too. I am so glad that somebody is finally listening.\u201d We are not just listening, we are acting\u2014indeed, we have already acted.
