Too many children in the North and Midlands, I reported, are being taught in schools that are not good enough.

I\u2019m calling on them to be visible, high-profile figures that people can recognize as education champions. I am calling on them to make education in general \u2013 and their underperforming secondary schools in particular \u2013 a central target of their strategy for growth.
