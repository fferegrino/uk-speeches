        "Last Friday, FIFA\u2019s members had the opportunity to embrace the overwhelming call for change that is coming from football fans around the world. They failed to do so. FIFA\u2019s support for its discredited president was incredibly disappointing, but it will not have surprised the footballing public who have become increasingly cynical as the allegations of misconduct and malfeasance have piled up. FIFA needs to change\u2014and to change now. I can assure the House that the Government will do all in their power to help bring change about.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations",
        "I have just spoken to Football Association chairman, Greg Dyke, and assured him that we stand behind the English FA\u2019s efforts to end the culture of kickbacks and corruption that risk ruining international football for a generation.

        "Let me also reiterate the Government\u2019s support for the action of the American and Swiss authorities. Earlier today, I spoke with the Attorney General.

        "FIFA\u2019s voting system is designed to support the incumbent, and it returned a predictable result, but there is no doubt that what remained of Sepp Blatter\u2019s credibility has been utterly destroyed. The mere fact that more than 70 national associations felt able to back a rival candidate shows that momentum against him is building. We must now increase that pressure still further.

        "I am sure that fans the world over will be increasingly vocal in their condemnation of the Blatter regime, and FIFA\u2019s sponsors need to think long and hard about whether they want to be associated with such a discredited and disgraced organisation.
