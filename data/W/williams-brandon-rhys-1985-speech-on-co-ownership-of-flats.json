        "It has often been pointed out that we have a certain unbalance where the acquisition of residential freehold is concerned. The House long ago agreed that in the private sector those living in houses on long leases should have the right of enfranchisement and be able to enjoy the benefit of freehold ownership. In the public sector the Government have made tremendous strides, which we all appreciate and are grateful for, by allowing people in council houses, and also in council flats, to acquire their own property. But people living in flats in private ownership are, as it were, second-rate citizens, because they do not have the right at present to acquire their freehold. I believe that a formula can be found, which is fair to both sides, that will encourage this type of home ownership for people living in flats.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations\n  *[Ofcom]: Office of Communications\n  *[COLT]: City Of London Telecom\n  *[4G]: fourth generation mobile network\n  *[5G]: fifth generation mobile network\n  *[DSIT]: Department for Science, Innovation and Technology\n  *[Defra]: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\n  *[2G]: second generation mobile network\n  *[3G]: third generation mobile network\n  *[6G]: sixth generation mobile network\n  *[ITU]: International Telecommunication Union\n  *[R&D]: research and development\n  *[OpenRAN]: Open Radio Access Networks\n  *[ONE]: Open Network Ecosystem",
        "On previous occasions the House has permitted me to introduce a Bill on this subject. I hope that on this occasion the Bill will make progress, in the sense that the Minister will pay serious attention to the problems, of which he is well aware, which are really widespread in inner London and in other parts of the country. I am honoured that he has chosen to be present during the debate this afternoon. Such things are very much appreciated on the Back Benches.  \nI shall deal with the Bill as briefly as possible. The purpose is to provide a convenient statutory means by which the tenants and the lessees of purpose-built blocks of flats\u2014or buildings converted so as to consist only of self-contained flats\u2014may act jointly to purchase their landlord\u2019s interest in the property at a fair valuation. The Bill would not apply to any property in owner-occupation or to any property consisting of fewer than four self-contained flats, and it would not, of course, extend to local authority properties.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations\n  *[Ofcom]: Office of Communications\n  *[COLT]: City Of London Telecom\n  *[4G]: fourth generation mobile network\n  *[5G]: fifth generation mobile network\n  *[DSIT]: Department for Science, Innovation and Technology\n  *[Defra]: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\n  *[2G]: second generation mobile network\n  *[3G]: third generation mobile network\n  *[6G]: sixth generation mobile network\n  *[ITU]: International Telecommunication Union\n  *[R&D]: research and development\n  *[OpenRAN]: Open Radio Access Networks\n  *[ONE]: Open Network Ecosystem",
        "The Bill would specify that in order to exercise the right of purchase a company \u2014 which I suggest might be known as a condominium company, making use of an expression which is very well understood in the United States\u2014could be formed, in accordance with a model \u200b constitution, which would include provisions to ensure that a block of flats acquired by the tenants under the Bill\u2019s provisions would be properly managed. There is a danger that enthusiastic tenants\u2019 associations might overreach themselves by acquiring properties which were in need of serious repair and then find that they could not raise enough money among themselves to look after the block properly. That, of course, would lead to dissension and bad feeling, such as there was in the days when there were two sides and the owners were reluctant to find the necessary capital and the people living in the flats felt that the block was being neglected.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations\n  *[Ofcom]: Office of Communications\n  *[COLT]: City Of London Telecom\n  *[4G]: fourth generation mobile network\n  *[5G]: fifth generation mobile network\n  *[DSIT]: Department for Science, Innovation and Technology\n  *[Defra]: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\n  *[2G]: second generation mobile network\n  *[3G]: third generation mobile network\n  *[6G]: sixth generation mobile network\n  *[ITU]: International Telecommunication Union\n  *[R&D]: research and development\n  *[OpenRAN]: Open Radio Access Networks\n  *[ONE]: Open Network Ecosystem",
        "The Bill would grant to a properly constituted condominium company the right of pre-emption, to be exercised within a maximum of six months. That, I think, is not very controversial. When a block has been put on the market, most people feel that a tenants\u2019 or residents\u2019 association, if it acts quickly and responsibly, should have a right of pre-emption.

        "It would be permissible for a condominium company to issue debentures and also participating preference shares; and it could qualify for grant on the same terms as a housing association. I am very anxious that a residents\u2019 association, properly constituted, should have assistance in the early years from building societies and other financial institutions. All too often they are reluctant to lend money on fixed-interest terms, but willing to enter into some sort of participatory arrangement so that they can take their money out after a relatively short time with an element of profit involved.
