        "Let me examine the reality in a university with about 5,000 undergraduates. The student union receives indirectly from the taxpayer and the ratepayer 5,000 times, say, \u00a340 a year. This money is \u200b distributed to various clubs and societies by the vote of the student union general meeting. These meetings claim to decide what 5,000 students collectively desire, but they are usually attended, by political activists numbering no more than 150 to 200. Such student politicians rarely, in my experience, represent the silent majority of student opinion and, politically, they make certain hon.

Are there so many homosexual students at Reading University that public funds must be spent to sustain such activities? Another \u00a3200 is being paid to a group of students to allow them to play war games with toy soldiers and a further \u00a395 has been given to GAFIA.

        "Hon. Members may think that Reading is not typical of all universities, so let us go to Essex, as I did on 11th May to address a public meeting. When I arrived, I was confronted with my image plastered all over the campus. Across the posters that showed photographs of me was daubed in red the word \u201cEliminate\u201d. That was not all. Underneath the photograph were words that I would not care to repeat, even in the House. This sort of material was provided by funds given to an organisation at the university by the National Union of Students and, therefore, came from the taxpayers and ratepayers of this country. While some are driven to do unpleasant things to prevent me from promoting my principles, I leave it to hon.

In this way, it will be possible for the individual student to decide how to spend the money on his or her leisure pursuits.
