However, people in the UK often still have to use a combination of paper documents issued by Government, local authorities and the private sector\u2014and a mixture of offline and online routes\u2014when opening a bank account, claiming benefits, starting a new job or applying for a school place.

        "The consultation DCMS is publishing today follows up on that commitment. It sits alongside the UK digital identity and attributes trust framework, which was published as a first draft in February 2021, opening the way for legislation.
