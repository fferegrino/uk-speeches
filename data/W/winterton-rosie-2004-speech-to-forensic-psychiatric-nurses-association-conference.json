        "And why do we want to that? Why have we made mental health one of the top three priorities for the NHS? For me as a politician it is about a belief \u2013 a belief that people with mental health problems are some of the most vulnerable in our society \u2013 some of the most socially excluded. And I believe that our society should be judged by how we treat vulnerable people \u2013 how we eradicate social exclusion. And that\u2019s why I believe we should strive as a government to ensure we provide high quality mental health services, assessable to all who need them. That we create a working environment where we value our staff and maximise their potential.
