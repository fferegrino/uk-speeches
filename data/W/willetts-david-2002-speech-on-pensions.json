        "That this House agrees with the Government\u2019s stated aim of increasing from 40 per cent. to 60 per cent. the proportion of pensioners\u2019 incomes that comes from the private sector, but condemns the Government for failing to pursue policies which would achieve this objective and instead imposing a massive \u00a35 billion annual tax on pension funds, and for presiding over the lowest savings ratio since records began; notes that fewer than four in ten final salary schemes are now open to new members and is shocked by the Government\u2019s complacency in the face of widespread concern about the future of funded pensions: and therefore calls on the Government to cut the burden of regulation on pension funds, reverse the spread of means testing among pensioners, reform annuities and provide better incentives for people to save, so that they can enjoy a prosperous retirement.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations\n  *[Ofcom]: Office of Communications\n  *[COLT]: City Of London Telecom\n  *[4G]: fourth generation mobile network\n  *[5G]: fifth generation mobile network\n  *[DSIT]: Department for Science, Innovation and Technology\n  *[Defra]: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\n  *[2G]: second generation mobile network\n  *[3G]: third generation mobile network\n  *[6G]: sixth generation mobile network\n  *[ITU]: International Telecommunication Union\n  *[R&D]: research and development\n  *[OpenRAN]: Open Radio Access Networks\n  *[ONE]: Open Network Ecosystem",

        "A wide range of well-known companies have closed their final salary schemes to new members\u2014Barclays, British Airways, British Telecom, ICI, Lloyds TSB, Marks and Spencer, and Sainsbury. We know from the Government\u2019s own statistics that 59 per cent. of recently retired pensioners now have an income from an occupational pension, against 67 per cent. of recently retired pensioners when Labour came into office. Fewer pensioners are now retiring with an income from an occupational pension. The number of employees without a funded pension arrangement has grown from 40 per cent. to 44 per cent in the past two years alone.

        "I wish to press the Secretary of State for more information on the two serious errors made by his Department in the past few months. The first mistake was in respect of the assets in our pension funds. Originally, the Government said that at the end of 1999 we had \u00a3784 billion in our pension funds\u2014quite a lot of money. Then, without any explanation or prior notice, they produced a revised set of figures that showed that at the same date\u2014at the end of 1999\u2014they had reduced their estimate of the assets in our pension funds to \u00a3679 billion.

        "I want to make two points. First, it is incorrect to compare the capital value of the loss of the value of shares\u2014the capital effect\u2014which may be hundreds of billions of pounds, with the flow of \u00a35 billion as a tax hit. We have to realise that this is not just a one-off tax hit; it is \u00a35 billion a year. That is why it is so significant. If we calculate the current cost of a \u00a35 billion-a-year tax, we get a very large sum indeed.  \nMy second point is that Labour Members regularly mention enormous figures for the total fall in the value of the stock exchange. They now seem keen to tell us how much value shares have lost under their management\u2014that is the point that they like to make. They talk as if those shares all belong to pension funds. Pension funds own only about 18 per cent. of British equities, so it is not correct to compare the \u00a35 billion, which is merely the annual effect of the tax, with the \u00a3450 billion, which is the total loss in value of all shares, of which only a small proportion are held by pension funds.

        "I am doubly grateful to the hon. Gentleman. Is not it true that ACT has had the effect that it has because the Conservative Government forced pension funds to run down their surpluses? Had they not been forced so to do, many more funds would have had greater buoyancy to enable them to withstand the ACT changes. The running down of surpluses pushed more pensions nearer to the precipice.
