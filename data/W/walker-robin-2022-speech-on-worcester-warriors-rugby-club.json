        "It is a great honour to secure this debate, on an issue that is very dear to my heart. In recent weeks, Warriors fans have grown accustomed to the odd delay, and I apologise to all those who may have tuned in at 5 pm or 5.30 pm, but I hope I am able to evoke their concerns during the course of the debate. I am very grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey (Stuart Andrew) for taking up his role, and look forward to his response. I am also grateful to the Clerks in the Table Office for accommodating me at the first possible opportunity after the period of mourning. Sadly, this debate is all too urgent and timely.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations",
        "Worcester Warriors is a rugby club that has been at the heart of our county and community for decades, and follows in the footsteps of the Worcester rugby football club, who have played rugby union in Worcester for over 150 years. In the era of professional rugby, which roughly coincides with my adult lifetime, the club has been based at Sixways, and throughout my adult life I have been a supporter. The first game of professional rugby I ever watched was in Worcester; the club was then in North Midlands division 2, and although never a player myself, I have worn the club colours of gold and blue ever since. When I gave Worcester rugby shirts to my two nephews, then aged four and eight, they described them as their Uncle Robin suits, as they had so often seen me wearing mine. As is the case for so many other local folk, the club has provided a forum for intergenerational bonding, an arena for local pride, and a gathering space for special events.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations",
        "The rise and rise of Worcester, who subsequently became the Warriors, was no accident, but the result of the vision and drive of one man: Worcester\u2019s most successful 20th century entrepreneur and philanthropist, the late, great Cecil Duckworth. It is not possible to overstate Cecil\u2019s contribution to our city. The boiler he first made in his garage became the prototype of the modern combi boiler and the basis for Worcester Heat Systems, now known as Worcester Bosch, the biggest private sector employer in my constituency. His endowment of the Duckworth Worcestershire Trust continues to make an enormous contribution to our local environment, and his generous support for the Acorns Children\u2019s Hospice made its Worcester hospice a reality.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations",
        "Cecil\u2019s greatest and most prominent local legacy, however, was the rise of the Warriors. I was privileged to know Cecil and his family long before I became Worcester\u2019s MP, and to be able to watch rugby at Sixways with him. I recall watching a pre-season friendly between Worcester and Oxford University while I was a student there, and learning that even great figures such as Cecil and his opposite number at the university rugby team, who happened to be a former head of the civil service and distinguished member of the other place, were capable of colourful language when the referee\u2019s decision went against their team. I celebrated with him an astonishing six successive league wins and promotions as, with his support, the Warriors\u2014as they became in 2002\u2014moved all the way up from North Midlands division 2 to National league 1, the league just beneath the rugby premiership. I well remember the ecstatic feeling when our team, unbeaten after 26 wins in 26 matches, first won promotion to the top flight in the 2003-04 season.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations",
        "Like so many fans, I experienced the pain of relegation in 2009, followed by joy at our return to the top flight in my first year as Worcester\u2019s MP. All of this was masterminded by Cecil and his passion to see the club not just achieve, but cement, its position at the top of English rugby. When I first attended Sixways, there was one stand with a capacity of around 2,000; today we have a 12,000 capacity stadium, which is not only one of the best-equipped professional rugby stadiums in the country but a venue for key local cultural events, from concerts to the trooping of the Mercian Regiment\u2019s colour. Quite rightly, a bust of Cecil adorns the Warriors\u2019 stadium, and he was named life president of the club before his sad death from cancer in 2020.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations",
        "While some might say that the Warriors is just a sports club, we in Worcester know it is much more than that. So many fans have spoken out about what the club means to them, and the staff and heads of department, as well as the players, have shown a spirit of togetherness in the toughest of times of which Cecil himself would be proud. I do not have time to echo all the sentiments of fans in this short debate, but so many have expressed what the clubs mean to them movingly and with real passion. I commend to the House looking at #together, #WeAreWarriors and #SaveOurWarriors on social media.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations",
        "The club is also home to one of the most effective and successful community foundations in the rugby world\u2014this is a key part of Cecil\u2019s vision\u2014which reaches more than 15,000 deprived and vulnerable people across the west midlands, championing accessible rugby, delivering innovative and inspiring lessons in schools, including special schools and alternative provision, using the power of rugby to build confidence and unlock opportunity. I have lost count of the number of times I have been downstairs in this place to congratulate the foundation on winning awards at the premier rugby community awards.

        "The current owners of the club have brought it to the brink of financial collapse, and for all that they have claimed this is the impact of the pandemic, they have failed to maintain the trust of their employees, keep their promises to local stakeholders or set out clear plans to reassure their many creditors. Their background in property development and the various complex transactions through which they have manoeuvred parts of the club and its land have raised serious doubts about their genuine commitment to keeping professional rugby at Sixways.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations",
        "The news that on 17 August the owners had been served with a winding up notice by Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs led dozens of my constituents to contact me with their concerns about the future of the club. On 26 August, I convened a meeting of local MPs and council leaders from all the three south Worcestershire councils and the county to discuss the concerns about any possibility of development land being separated from the club, and the risks to the viability of the stadium and the team. We agreed a joint statement. Crucially, included in this were the leaders of Wychavon District Council, the planning authority and Worcestershire County Council, with its responsibilities for economic development.

        "In the days of confusion and deep concern that followed, the players were eventually paid\u2014late and sometimes irregularly. But together, selflessly, they decided to withdraw their notice and return to being in contract. The staff; 200 of whom are permanent full-time staff, with a further 200 part-time, were offered 65% of their wages, with the rest to follow once a deal had been secured.

        "Each one of those assertions is challengeable. From my own conversations with both PRL and the RFU, I know that neither the triggering of a call option on the P share, nor relegation should be considered a certainty. I urge them to do all they can in the event of an orderly administration to enable Warriors to stay in the premiership, with a points deduction if necessary, and to ensure that any new management and investors taking the club on have access to its P share. There is no reason why an administrator or new investor should not be able to honour season tickets, and local suppliers who from bitter experience have no trust in the current owners to pay their bills may stand a greater chance of recouping some of what they are owed if we have an orderly process rather than continued uncertainty and disorder.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations",
        "Since that time, I am afraid that the situation off the pitch has not improved. Players have gone above and beyond to turn out and play for the club, despite the problems with their pay. Staff have moved heaven and earth to ensure that games can go ahead, meeting the challenges set by the RFU and PRL, even after wi-fi and internal emails went down, and with no support from their directors and owners. That Worcester Warriors players have scored tries against London Irish, Exeter Chiefs and Gloucester is a remarkable achievement in these most difficult circumstances. The solidarity that has been shown by each of those clubs reflects the desire of all rugby clubs to see the Warriors survive. That the University of Worcester Warriors\u2014the ladies\u2019 team\u2014actually won its Allianz cup fixture against Harlequins is truly spectacular. The heroic efforts of underpaid or unpaid staff have been praised by fans of clubs across the country, but those efforts are barely acknowledged by the current owners. Instead, we have had reports of staff facing disciplinary action for daring to point out the string of broken promises that have been made to them, and of key people being mysteriously unavailable when legal or insurance documentation needed to be signed.

They promised staff and fans an announcement within 48 hours of the match on Sunday. Neither of those promises has been kept. Staff, fans and players are left with the lingering doubt that the owners might prefer the club to default on its rugby commitments so that expulsion from the premiership makes it easier to focus on developing the property assets away from the rugby. Such an outcome would risk making not only the Warriors but the Community Foundation, the academy, the amateur Worcester rugby football club and the Worcester Raiders football club homeless.

We all know that, but it is not the point. The concern is that the new lease negotiated at Sport England\u2019s behest changed the terms on which the rugby trading company held use of the stadium, and reduced its access to non-rugby income and the proceeds of any events other than those related to the game itself.

One senior player has described the suggestion as \u201cheart- breaking.\u201d What is also striking, having now discussed the matter with Beatrice\u2014Cecil\u2019s widow\u2014is that the money was borrowed in January 2020, before any impact of the pandemic and long before the owners admitted to the current financial woes of the club, with the express intention of making payroll. Within a few years of taking control of the club and after one of their original investors pulled out, they went to the great founder and benefactor of the Warrior\u2019s success and borrowed half a million pounds.

        "The owners have asserted that half of the money is not owed, as a promise was made on the basis of a handshake for Cecil to cover the costs of employing the then manager of the club, Alan Solomons. Although there is no documentary evidence to back that claim, the family have accepted that they will not contest it. Even after this, there has been no further engagement with the Duckworth family on the remaining money. I cannot express in parliamentary terms my personal revulsion at the way in which those charged with protecting Cecil Duckworth\u2019s legacy have behaved and seemingly continue to behave. I am told that the loan does not appear anywhere in the published accounts of the club or the holding companies, which prompts questions as to how they are meeting their legal responsibilities as directors and what other undeclared debts they may have taken on.

Two weeks ago, I and my fellow Worcestershire colleagues spoke out with one voice to call on DCMS to step in and take the Warriors into administration, in order to secure its future.
