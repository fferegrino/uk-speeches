We took powers to require the display of maximum prices for these subsidised foods and the orders on that are going out at the present time.

        "Well, there\u2019s lots and lots of points to take up there. And perhaps we could start with subsidies? Now the classic argument is you must know only too well against food subsidies is that we all get them, regardless of whether we need them or not.

        "Oh, Tony, you\u2019ve got yourself stuck into a statistical difficulty that all the House of Commons got itself stuck in, so I can\u2019t blame you. No, it\u2019s 24% of households. But you see, most pensioners are households of one or two people. So that that many households represents far more people than the household figure gives you. Now we know three things about this. The first says that pensioners benefit most, they actually benefit in absolute terms most, that\u2019s to say they make more out of subsidies per head than anybody else in the population. Reason for this quite simply is they buy more staple foods and they spend more of their budget on food. They don\u2019t spend the same amount on cars and holidays and entertainment that no doubt you and I do. So they benefit the most, absolutely. They also benefit the most proportionately, and so do the poor families.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations\n  *[Ofcom]: Office of Communications\n  *[COLT]: City Of London Telecom\n  *[4G]: fourth generation mobile network\n  *[5G]: fifth generation mobile network\n  *[DSIT]: Department for Science, Innovation and Technology\n  *[Defra]: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\n  *[2G]: second generation mobile network\n  *[3G]: third generation mobile network\n  *[6G]: sixth generation mobile network\n  *[ITU]: International Telecommunication Union\n  *[R&D]: research and development\n  *[OpenRAN]: Open Radio Access Networks\n  *[ONE]: Open Network Ecosystem",
        "The other part of the argument, I\u2019ll be as quick about this as I can, of course it\u2019s true that the average benefit of 60 pence a week goes to everybody. But the great difference is that anybody who earns over 60 pounds a week is paying an extra tax much more than he\u2019s getting in subsidy. And anybody earning under 20 pounds a week is paying nothing extra in tax at all.

        "Now coming to nationalise industries prices. I mean, obviously, as the Prices Minister, I hate to see nationalise industries prices go up. But I think it\u2019s fair to say that the scale of the subsidy was running at about 1,400 million pounds at the end of February, that the only way to sustain this would have been a massive further increase in income tax and other taxes including VAT. Therefore the feeling was in the government, and indeed in the Conservative government before it, that we could had to set a ceiling to these nationalised industry subsidies.
