Robbins does briefly flirt with the idea of student loans, though as an idea for \u201c future experiment\u201d. He didn\u2019t have to focus on finance because the financial model had largely been set three years earlier by Sir Colin Anderson, in a report that paved the way for the introduction of a national student support system in 1962.

After all, universities are supposed to train the mind, so if you survey students when they arrive to assess how well, for example, they comprehend a complex argument and then measure them again when they leave, one might hope to see a clear improvement. Academically Adrift, the book by Arum & Roksa, tried such a measure in the US and got disappointingly modest returns. They found that \u201c45% of students did not demonstrate any significant improvement in learning during their first two years of college\u201d.
