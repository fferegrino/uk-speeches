I have heard that the first day was really successful and I hope those of you who were able to go to the dinner last night enjoyed the splendid meal. Deborah Veal\u2019s story is truly inspirational and we can all learn from her attitude and approach.  \nI want to spend a little time looking at what has been done in Occupational Health.

        "But first I do want to say how important Occupational Health services are to delivering the NHS of the future. We employ 1.3 million people in the NHS in England, and recruiting more. The importance of an effective occupational health and safety service has never been more obvious. We value the dedication and commitment of NHS staff and we should be showing it by providing Occupational Health services which demonstrate that. Whether in preventing workplace illness or in ensuring staff are offered speedy rehabilitation back into work, Occupational Health services help deliver first rate care. It makes good business sense and meets our legal duties.

Her proposal to review the evidence about risks to health at work for pregnant staff and nursing mothers returning to work \u2013 and how we can avoid these risks \u2013 was excellent.
