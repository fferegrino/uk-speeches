        "The BBC is operationally independent, so the announcement yesterday is very much its decision, but taxpayers want to see the BBC using its substantial licence fee income appropriately to ensure it delivers for UK audiences, and that includes showing restraint on salaries for senior staff. In 2017-18, the BBC received over \u00a33.8 billion in licence fee income\u2014more than ever before. The BBC is also making over \u00a31 billion a year from commercial work, such as selling content abroad, which can be reinvested.
