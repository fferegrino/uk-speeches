        "Despite this pamphlet\u2019s rather grim title and the even grimmer photograph on the cover, this is not another bleak account of how we can\u2019t afford our pensions because we are all living too long. Instead, it is an attempt to get beyond the financial analysis of the pension crisis to a deeper understanding of the demographic and social changes behind it. And actually I am quite optimistic that societies and economies can adjust and will carry on doing so.

        "The pamphlet begins by clearing away the widespread misconception that somehow the problem is that we are all living too long. It is good news that life expectancy is improving. These are not extra years of miserable incapacity; if anything we die fitter than before. Anyway life expectancy has been improving pretty steadily for 150 years. The problem is not longevity. The problem is that there are not enough young workers coming along behind. After the baby boom of the 1950s we have had the baby bust.

        "The biggest single reason for the golden years of growth in the 1980s and 1990s was that many European countries had a surge in the number of people of working age. We have had virtually no increase in the number of pensioners in Britain for 20 years and with falling birth rates we have had fewer children to maintain as well. The population has been bunched in the middle like a rabbit in a python. That means lots of producers and consumers and not many dependents. The fundamental economic change facing Europe over the next 50 years, is that the EU will have an extra 40 million people aged over 60 and an absolute reduction of 40 million in the number of people aged 15-60. The EU Commission has shown that this change in the age composition of the EU\u2019s population will on its own reduce its underlying growth rate from 2.1% to 1.3% per annum. America faces a very different demographic prospect. It is a younger country with a higher birth rate and much more migration. Its underlying growth rate will carry on at about 2.5%. America\u2019s population will overtake Europe\u2019s in about 2030. In 2050 America\u2019s economy will be an even bigger share of the world economy than it is today \u2013 perhaps up from 23% to 26%. Europe\u2019s, by contrast, will have fallen from 18% to 10%. This is why the age composition of the population matters. By 2050 Europe will have a shrinking population, a low underlying growth, and a falling share of world output.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations\n  *[Ofcom]: Office of Communications\n  *[COLT]: City Of London Telecom\n  *[4G]: fourth generation mobile network\n  *[5G]: fifth generation mobile network\n  *[DSIT]: Department for Science, Innovation and Technology\n  *[Defra]: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\n  *[2G]: second generation mobile network\n  *[3G]: third generation mobile network\n  *[6G]: sixth generation mobile network\n  *[ITU]: International Telecommunication Union\n  *[R&D]: research and development\n  *[OpenRAN]: Open Radio Access Networks\n  *[ONE]: Open Network Ecosystem",
        "Of course all of this does have an effect on pensions. We used to be complacent and think that somehow Britain was uniquely blessed when it came to pensions. Such complacency is long since over. At the heart of all this is the question of how we register claims on future resources. One way you can do it is a pay-as-you-go system in which future workers pay taxes to pay benefits. This can be sustained provided that you have got enough future workers to pay the taxes. It is the interaction of a pay-as-you-go system and a shrinking workforce which is devastating.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations\n  *[Ofcom]: Office of Communications\n  *[COLT]: City Of London Telecom\n  *[4G]: fourth generation mobile network\n  *[5G]: fifth generation mobile network\n  *[DSIT]: Department for Science, Innovation and Technology\n  *[Defra]: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\n  *[2G]: second generation mobile network\n  *[3G]: third generation mobile network\n  *[6G]: sixth generation mobile network\n  *[ITU]: International Telecommunication Union\n  *[R&D]: research and development\n  *[OpenRAN]: Open Radio Access Networks\n  *[ONE]: Open Network Ecosystem",
        "There is a widespread misconception that somehow the Continent\u2019s problem is that they don\u2019t have enough savings. This is untrue. Continent savings are not explicitly linked to age and therefore don\u2019t count as pension assets, though many of them, especially in France, are in practice used to finance retirement.

        "I then look in the pamphlet at three ways in which economies can respond. One option is for us all to work more. But this is easier said than done. High employment societies are very different from low employment ones. The best way to get more people into employment is to have a diverse labour market with a whole range of different types of work as many people, such as students or disabled people or parents with young children, might not wish to work in a conventional full-time job. The regulation of the European labour market around some notion of a standard job with standard hours is the biggest single obstacle to increasing employment. Even if there were a transformation in Europe\u2019s rate of employment we would be running to stand still. The absolute fall in the number of workers is so dramatic that the EU could reach its target of a 70% employment rate and still be facing reductions in its workforce.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations\n  *[Ofcom]: Office of Communications\n  *[COLT]: City Of London Telecom\n  *[4G]: fourth generation mobile network\n  *[5G]: fifth generation mobile network\n  *[DSIT]: Department for Science, Innovation and Technology\n  *[Defra]: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\n  *[2G]: second generation mobile network\n  *[3G]: third generation mobile network\n  *[6G]: sixth generation mobile network\n  *[ITU]: International Telecommunication Union\n  *[R&D]: research and development\n  *[OpenRAN]: Open Radio Access Networks\n  *[ONE]: Open Network Ecosystem",
        "Migration is another way in which economies can adjust. The UK has shifted to mass migration over the past few years. Increasing migration has been explicitly used by the Treasury to justify their claims that our underlying growth rate has gone up. But even if total output grows because of migration, output per head does not. This is why our productivity performance under Gordon Brown has been so poor. Moreover, competition at the bottom of the labour market forces drives down the wages of the low paid, hence the increase in income inequality which we have seen under this Labour Government. It is also difficult to see how any major European country could absorb the number of migrants that would be needed in order to offset the big demographic changes.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations\n  *[Ofcom]: Office of Communications\n  *[COLT]: City Of London Telecom\n  *[4G]: fourth generation mobile network\n  *[5G]: fifth generation mobile network\n  *[DSIT]: Department for Science, Innovation and Technology\n  *[Defra]: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\n  *[2G]: second generation mobile network\n  *[3G]: third generation mobile network\n  *[6G]: sixth generation mobile network\n  *[ITU]: International Telecommunication Union\n  *[R&D]: research and development\n  *[OpenRAN]: Open Radio Access Networks\n  *[ONE]: Open Network Ecosystem",
        "There is one other option \u2013 to have more babies. Europe faces a birth-dearth. Nobody wants to force women to have more children than they wish.
