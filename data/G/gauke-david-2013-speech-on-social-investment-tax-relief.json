        "In fact, as something of an amateur historian, when I was given the rather grand job title of Exchequer Secretary to Her Majesty\u2019s Treasury three and a half years ago, I thought it would be a good idea to investigate its history.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",

        "In that context \u2013 when I was looking at the history of the term social enterprise \u2013 I was not surprised that it predated the title, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, but not by as much as I might have thought.

        "And we recognise the important role it currently plays.
