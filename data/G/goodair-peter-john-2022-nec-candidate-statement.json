        "I have been a lifelong supporter of the Labour Party. I am passionate about the need to bring about a fairer society, remove poverty and homelessness and address the underlying factors causing them. As a member of the NEC I will argue strongly for policies that will help deliver these objectives as well as improving the health and wellbeing of disadvantaged citizens. I also believe in the importance of improving public transport and implementing measures to combat climate change. I believe in the need for progressive taxation so that those who are well off bear a larger share of the tax burden. I have held significant roles in Whitehall including policy formulation in environment and health and safety and have a strong understanding of the machinery of government.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union"
