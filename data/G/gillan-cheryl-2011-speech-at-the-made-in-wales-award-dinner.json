        "Good evening ladies and gentlemen. I am delighted to be here today at the inaugural \u2018Made in Wales\u2019 Award Dinner.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union",

        "It is right that we draw attention to what we are producing in Wales. I am a strong believer in Wales talking to the world and promoting itself in the global marketplace. We need to do more of this.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union",
        "Global brands like Airbus and GE, based here in Wales, are already doing this. But I want to see more smaller business doing it too. Wales is already a good place to do business, and we are committed to making Wales an even better place to do business.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union",
        "But we cannot do that without our plan to reduce the deficit and restore the UK\u2019s credibility on international markets. Earlier this month, the rating agency Standard and Poor reaffirmed the UK\u2019s AAA rating, whilst downgrading a number of other countries.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union",
        "This confirms that we must stay committed to our programme of fiscal consolidation and the reduction of the deficit. This is a highly competitive market place and a tough economic climate. But our plan was designed in tough times, for tough times.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union",
        "Our plan has brought stability and confidence to the economy. It has held down the costs of borrowing for businesses and homeowners.

        "We recognise that it will be the private sector, like you, who will lead the economic recovery in the UK.

        "We are building on the Plan for Growth through direct action such as the further cut to corporation tax we have already implemented. Over the next four years, we will cut the rate annually, bringing it to 23% \u2013 the lowest in the G7. We are securing access to finance for businesses through our Project Merlin agreement with the big UK High Street banks and we are investing in infrastructure \u2013 \u00a31 billion to electrify the Great Western Mainline into South Wales and \u00a356.9 million to expand and improve broadband infrastructure across Wales.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union",

        "We need to be positive about what we have in Wales rather than looking to what we don\u2019t have.

        "I recognise that many of you here tonight are already highly successful in the export market, and there is much that smaller companies in Wales can learn from.
