        "And we know how many people it affects, something like 80% of people with disabilities live in developing countries. And the barriers that people face aren\u2019t just physical ones, although we know that there are many and that they are immense.

        "So this is a complex set of challenges that we have to address and the consequences of not doing it means that we will have this status quo, that we have currently got, where we know that people with disabilities are more likely to be unemployed, they are less likely to get to school, in some cases they literally won\u2019t be able to participate in life.

        "So what have we been doing? I\u2019ll spend a little bit of time talking about what we have done over the last year. So this time last year we published this Disability Framework which set out the architecture of how we were going to look at disability and how we were going to start thinking about it within our own policy work. One year on I think we have seen some real progress and we have already started making changes.

        "Not a particularly big change for us was to say that if we are involved in building schools then they should be able to be accessible for everyone.
