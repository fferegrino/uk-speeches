        "So I have one essential message that I want to get across today. I am behind you; Michael Spurr is behind you \u2013 in your desire to lead your prisons, not just manage them.

        "If we want safer streets, we must first have safer prisons  \nIf we give you \u2013 the people in this room \u2013 more freedom and support then I believe we can make all our prisons much more effective at rehabilitation.
