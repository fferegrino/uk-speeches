        "Thank you for that kind introduction. And let me thank staff and pupils at Stockwell Park High School for the invitation to come here and talk about reading.

        "The great irony of course, is that when Dickens was writing, few were reading. Fewer than half of children attended early Victorian schools, industrial revolution brought terrible poverty and hardship.

High quality international evidence has demonstrated that the systematic teaching of synthetic phonics is the best way of making sure young children acquire the crucial skills they need to read new text, so driving up standards in reading.

        "In the words of US Education Secretary Arne Duncan, we are being \u2018out educated\u2019.

        "The national picture on literacy is more mixed. In 2011, four out of five 11-year-olds achieved what we expect in reading.

By the end of primary school, we want children to be able to read fluently, to interpret a book\u2019s meaning, and be able to enjoy more complex books by the likes of Morpurgo, Wilson and Dahl.

        "Likewise, I am a huge admirer of the Reading Agency\u2019s Summer Reading Challenge, which persuaded 760,000 children to pick up books over the summer.

        "Finally, we must pay thanks to the authors themselves whose creativity and talent propels children and young people into reading.
