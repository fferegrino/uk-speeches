        "Without wanting to dwell on quite how long ago that was, it\u2019s fair to say that the legal world I experienced then as a trainee solicitor is very different to the one I see today as Lord Chancellor. In the 1990s, the internet was in its infancy. Concepts like AI and machine learning were the preserve of science fiction.

These characteristics should not make a difference.\u201d I agree. And I think there are important strides being made on diversity. For the first time, we have three female justices in the Supreme Court.
