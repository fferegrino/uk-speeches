        "I don\u2019t think [face masks] will be mandatory, but I would encourage people to wear a face mask when they\u2019re inside and in an environment where they might be mixing with others and where the ventilation may not be as good as it might. So, I think that it is basic good manners, courtesy, consideration, to wear a face mask if you, for example, are in a shop. But, I trust peoples\u2019 good sense, and the Government does look at all times at the emerging evidence and, if necessary, then tough measures will be taken. On the whole, my view is that it\u2019s always better to trust peoples\u2019 common sense and to give them a clear sense of what is wise and that individuals and businesses are responding well to that.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study"
