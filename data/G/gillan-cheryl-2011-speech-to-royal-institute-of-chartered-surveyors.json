        "I don\u2019t think I need to say to this audience that the UK government is committed to and recognises the contribution and importance of the construction industry to the UK economy and of course to Wales.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union",
        "Despite the challenging economic news elsewhere, and believe you me it is challenging, I would like you to know in the first quarter of this year the Index of Construction for Wales showed a rise of 2.6 percent. You probably all know this very well. That is a testament to the hard work of businesses here and particularly when you compare that figure to the UK wide position which showed a decline of 4 percent. So I think that we did better than average here in Wales.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union",
        "And I am also incredibly proud that Welsh Architects and builders have been responsible for so many of our iconic Welsh landmarks. Jonathan Adams inspired the Wales Millennium Centre here in Cardiff and I don\u2019t know how many of you have been to, for example, Mostyn Gallery in Llandudno. I visited some time ago and I think it\u2019s lovely. Of course, Hafod Eryri, perched high up on Snowdon, which I have still to visit.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union",
        "But I think we have to be confident in bringing forward new, innovative and bold designs. We should not suppress or inhibit creative talent in Wales. I think we have talent in our country here which is to be applauded.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union",

        "You only have to look at the roof tops across the country \u2013 and some of our iconic buildings, the Millennium Centre and of course the Senedd. You can see the versatility and practicality of fine Welsh slate and that provides a great material for designers, and the construction and building industry.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union",
        "Our builders of the past are also well recognised.

        "Welsh waterways are a credit to the built environment history in Wales and I think the aqueduct truly deserves its recognition as a UNESCO world heritage site. And visiting it showed me that innovation, vision and creativity are not new ideals, I think the design and construction industry in Wales has benefited from these specialist skills for many, many years.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union",

And your contributions have a direct and lasting impact on our towns and cities, and on the infrastructure that links them together. This morning we were talking about roads, bridges, rail networks, ports, airports and everyone in this room represent a vital role, a role that is played in the physical and social development of our society for today and in the future, and in the quality of life that people enjoy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union",

        "But of course there are challenges facing the construction industry right across the country. The economic situation we inherited is well known. Our aim is to ensure however that the private sector grows. And working with the Welsh government, our aim is to lock-in long term economic stability, job creation and prosperity, so that we open up opportunities for individuals and companies.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union",
        "It is of course the government\u2019s role to create the right environment for your industry to grow. But never make the mistake thinking that the government creates jobs. It is your businesses that create the jobs. We just have to create that more beneficial environment.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union",

        "In the first six months of this year, the UK economy has grown faster than the US economy \u2013 despite the latter\u2019s massive fiscal stimulus. The private sector has created over half a million extra jobs. Our borrowing costs have fallen to record lows showing that UK government debt is seen as a safe haven in the global debt storm and saving money for taxpayers, businesses and families.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union",
        "Despite what you read in the press there has also been record investment. Businesses have invested \u00a391.4 billion across our economy \u2013 that\u2019s up 9 per cent on the previous year. Britain\u2019s credit rating, which was put on negative outlook under the last government, has been restored to its highest possible level.

        "However, we have acknowledged that the current economic climate risks a shortfall in finance for capital projects, and that there are many conflicting priorities within the sector itself.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union",
        "At the last Budget we set out measures to improve the environment for business.

        "Our \u2018Plan for Growth\u2019 sets out a new wave of reforms to restore Britain\u2019s competitiveness.

        "Now, Phase 1 of the plan which we announced has over 130 reforms all aimed at making life easier for businesses to recruit and grow. Phase 2 is more ambitious \u2013 and particularly relevant to you today. It\u2019s going to specifically look at infrastructure: how to eliminate barriers and encourage infrastructure investment across the UK.
