        "Leaving the European Union is, I\u2019ve often argued, a bit like moving house. Instead of being lodgers under someone else\u2019s roof we are choosing a new place in the world where we\u2019re in control. Four years after we made the decision to leave the EU, the reasons for moving are stronger than ever.
