        "Mr. President, you, yourself, acknowledge the controversial timing of your comments on the EU referendum and the spirited debate that we\u2019re having here. And I think you\u2019re right. In the weeks before your arrival here, Leave campaigners have said that you\u2019re acting hypocritically. America would not accept the loss of sovereignty that we have to accept as part of the EU. America would not accept the levels of immigration from Mexico that we have to accept from the EU. And therefore, in various degrees of politeness, they have said to you that you should really keep your views to yourself. With that in mind, Mr. President, do you still think it was the right decision to intervene in this debate?

The United States and the UK designed a set of institutions \u2014 whether it was the United Nations, or the Bretton Woods structure, IMF, World Bank, NATO, across the board. Now, that, to some degree, constrained our freedom to operate. It meant that occasionally we had to deal with some bureaucracy. It meant that on occasion we have to persuade other countries, and we don\u2019t get 100 percent of what we want in each case. But we knew that by doing so, everybody was going to be better off \u2014 partly because the norms and rules that were put in place were reflective of what we believe. If there were more free markets around the world, and an orderly financial system, we knew we could operate in that environment.

        "I think the migration crisis amplifies a debate that\u2019s taking place not just in Europe, but in the United States as well. At a time of globalization, at a time when a lot of the challenges that we face are transnational, as opposed to just focused on one country, there is a temptation to want to just pull up the drawbridge, either literally or figuratively. We see that played out in some of the debates that are taking place in the U.S. presidential race. And that debate I think is accelerated in Europe.
