    "content": [
        "It cannot be right that hundreds of thousands of businesses have been shut out of the support promised to them in this time of crisis. Ministers need to sort their system out and urgently accelerate access to support. Failure to do so risks the future of all these businesses, the bread and butter of Britain\u2019s economy, as well as scores of livelihoods across the country."
