        "Mr Deputy Speaker,",
        "I can report today that the economy is continuing to recover \u2013 and recovering faster than forecast.",
        "We set out our plan.",
        "And together with the British people, we held our nerve.",
        "We\u2019re putting Britain right.",
        "But the job is far from done.",
        "Our country still borrows too much.",
        "We still don\u2019t invest enough, export enough or save enough.",
        "So today we do more to put that right.",
        "This is a Budget for building a resilient economy.",
        "If you\u2019re a maker, a doer or a saver: this Budget is for you.",
        "It is all part of a long term economic plan \u2013 a plan that is delivering security for the people of this country.",
        "I have never shied away from telling the British people about the difficult decisions we face.",
        "And just because things are getting better, I don\u2019t intend to do so today.",
        "Yes, the deficit is down by a third.",
        "Now in the coming year it will be down by a half.",
        "But it is still one of the highest in the world \u2013 so today we take further action to bring it down.",
        "Yes, investment and exports are up.",
        "But Britain\u2019s got twenty years of catching up to do \u2013 so today we back businesses who invest and export.",
        "Yes, manufacturing is growing again, and jobs are being created across the country.",
        "So today we support manufacturers and back all regions of our country.",
        "And while as a nation we\u2019re getting on top of our debts, for many decades Britain has borrowed too much and saved too little.",
        "So in this Budget we make sure hardworking people keep more of what they earn \u2013 and more of what they save.",
        "Yesterday we set out our support for parents with tax free childcare.",
        "Today support for savers is at the centre of this Budget, as we take another step towards our central mission: economic security for the people of Britain.",
        "**OBR and economic forecasts**",
        "Mr Deputy Speaker, let me turn to today\u2019s forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility.",
        "I am grateful to Robert Chote, Steve Nickell and their team \u2013 and thank Graham Parker for agreeing to serve with them for another term.",
        "It is a credit to the OBR that we now take for granted that figures presented at this Despatch Box are not fiddled but fair and independent.",
        "A year ago at the Budget the OBR forecast the economy to grow by just 0.6% in 2013.",
        "They now confirm that it grew by three times as much.",
        "At the Autumn Statement, they significantly revised up their expectations for future growth.",
        "Today I can tell the House they are revising up their forecast again.",
        "A year ago, they predicted growth in 2014 would be 1.8%. At the Autumn Statement, 2.4%. Today the OBR forecast growth in 2014 of 2.7%.",
        "That\u2019s the biggest upward revision to growth between Budgets for at least 30 years.",
        "Growth next year is also revised up to 2.3%.",
        "Then it\u2019s 2.6% in 2016 and 2017.",
        "And with the output gap closed around a year earlier than previously predicted, growth returns to around its long term trend, at 2.5% in 2018.",
        "Taken together, these growth figures mean our economy will be \u00a316 billion larger than was forecast just four months ago.",
        "Mr Deputy Speaker, there is another prediction the OBR make today the House will want to know about.",
        "Six years ago Britain suffered a Great Recession.",
        "We had the biggest bank bail out in the world.",
        "We had the biggest deficit since the war.",
        "We suffered the deepest recession in modern times.",
        "But later this year the OBR expects Britain to reach the point when our economy is finally larger than before it collapsed six years ago.",
        "That\u2019s because we\u2019re now growing faster than Germany, faster than Japan, faster than the US \u2013 in fact there is no major advanced economy in the world growing faster than Britain today.",
        "But we should be alert to the risks.",
        "The euro area is slowly recovering but as the OBR caution \u201cfurther damaging instability remains possible\u201d.",
        "There is volatility in emerging markets.",
        "And while for now the OBR do not expect the situation in Ukraine to have a \u201clarge impact\u201d on us, they warn that an escalation risks higher commodity prices, higher inflation and lower growth.",
        "It\u2019s a reminder of why we need to build our economy\u2019s resilience.",
        "**Employment forecasts**",
        "At home the biggest risk is clear: abandoning the economic plan that is working.",
        "And nowhere is the success of that plan more evident than in job creation.",
        "Today again we are reminded that the most important consequence of our plan is more people in work \u2013 with each job meaning a family more secure.",
        "The pace of net job creation under this government has been three times faster than in any other recovery on record.",
        "1.3 million more people in work.",
        "The latest figures today show a staggering 24% fall in the claimant count in just one year, and the fastest fall in the youth claimant count since 1997.",
        "The OBR today forecast one and a half million more jobs over the next five years.",
        "Unemployment down from the 8% we inherited to just over 5%.",
        "And the OBR predict earnings to grow faster than inflation this year and in every year of the forecast. That\u2019s why the country can afford a real terms increase in the National Minimum Wage.",
        "Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a government whose plan is delivering jobs.",
        "We now have:",
        "\u2013 a record number in work",
        "\u2013 a record number of women in work",
        "\u2013 and for the first time in 35 years, a higher employment rate than the United States of America",
        "That\u2019s what we mean when we say we\u2019re getting Britain working.",
        "**Fiscal**",
        "Mr Deputy Speaker, there can be no economic security if there is no control of the public finances.",
        "Before I presented my first Budget to this House, the government was borrowing one pound in every four it spent \u2013 and we were faced with the threat of a sovereign debt crisis.",
        "We have taken difficult decisions.",
        "But thanks to those decisions, the IMF now say that we are achieving the largest reduction in both the headline and the structural deficits of any major advanced economy in the world.",
        "There were those who said repeatedly that the deficit was going to go up.",
        "Instead I can tell the House that the Office for Budget Responsibility have revised down the underlying deficit in every year of their forecast.",
        "Before we came to office the deficit was 11%.",
        "This year they say it will be 6.6% \u2013 lower than forecast and down a third.",
        "Next year, 5.5% \u2013 down a half.",
        "Then it will fall to 4.2%, 2.4% and reach 0.8% in 2017-18.",
        "In 2018-19, they are forecasting no deficit at all \u2013 instead, at plus 0.2%, a small surplus.",
        "But only if we work through the plan.",
        "The government\u2019s fiscal mandate is met \u2013 and continues to be met a year early.",
        "And yet while the underlying structural deficit falls, it falls no faster than was previously forecast \u2013 despite higher growth.",
        "This goes to the heart of the argument this government has made:",
        "Faster growth alone will not balance the books.",
        "Securing Britain\u2019s economic future means there will have to be more hard decisions; more cuts.",
        "The question for the British people is: who has the credibility to deliver them?",
        "Let me turn to the underlying cash borrowing numbers.",
        "Britain was borrowing \u00a3157 billion a year before we came to office.",
        "This year we expect to borrow \u00a3108 billion.",
        "That\u2019s \u00a312 billion less than forecast a year ago.",
        "Indeed even since the Autumn Statement the OBR have revised down borrowing in every single year.",
        "In 2014-15 they say it will fall to \u00a395 billion.",
        "Then it falls again to \u00a375 billion in 2015-16, then \u00a344 billion, then down to \u00a317 billion.",
        "In 2018-19 we won\u2019t be borrowing at all. We will have a small surplus of almost \u00a35 billion.",
        "Taken together, these new figures mean Britain will be borrowing \u00a324 billion less than was forecast. That\u2019s more than we spend in an entire year on the Police and Criminal Justice system.",
        "Lower borrowing and a smaller deficit mean less debt.",
        "While we meet the debt target one year late as before, the OBR have revised down national debt in every single year of the forecast.",
        "They expect it to be 74.5% of GDP this year; 77.3% next year; peaking at 78.7% in 2015-16 \u2013 lower than the 80% previously forecast \u2013 before falling to 78.3% in 2016-17, then falling to 76.5% and then 74.2% in 2018-19.",
        "So Mr Deputy Speaker,",
        "Growth up.",
        "The deficit set to halve.",
        "Debt is lower.",
        "And the biggest single saving of all is a \u00a342 billion reduction in the interest payments we will have to make on that debt.",
        "Saving every family in the nation the equivalent of almost \u00a32,000.",
        "Money that was going to creditors around the world, now going to pay for the NHS and other public services.",
        "**Monetary policy**",
        "Mr Deputy Speaker it is because we have a credible fiscal plan that the Bank of England can provide the support needed to businesses and families.",
        "Yesterday, I confirmed the appointments of Anthony Habgood to Chair the Court and Ben Broadbent and Minouche Shafik to be the new Deputy Governors for Monetary Policy and Markets and Banking respectively.",
        "All three make a strong team at the Bank stronger still.",
        "I today re-confirm my remit for the Monetary Policy Committee, including the target of 2 per cent CPI inflation \u2013 which the OBR expect will be met this year, next year and in the years ahead.",
        "I also set out the remit for the Financial Policy Committee, the body created by us to avoid the mistakes of the past.",
        "Although the OBR forecast that house prices will remain below their real terms peak until at least 2018, I have asked the Committee to be particularly vigilant against the emergence of potential risks in the housing market.",
        "And to enhance our resilience, and protect us from economic shocks, we will also continue rebuilding our foreign exchange reserves.",
        "Those reserves are now 50% higher than when we came to office.",
        "**\u00a31 coin**",
        "Of course, the prerequisite of sound money is a sound currency.",
        "And, Mr Deputy Speaker, the \u00a31 coin has become increasingly vulnerable to forgery.",
        "Now among the oldest of coins in circulation; one in thirty pound coins are counterfeit \u2013 and that costs businesses and the taxpayer millions each year.",
        "So I can announce that we will move to a new, highly secure, \u00a31 coin.",
        "It will take three years. We will consult with industry.",
        "Our new pound coin will blend the security features of the future with inspiration from our past.",
        "In honour of our Queen, the coin will take the shape of one of the first coins she appeared on \u2013 the threepenny bit.",
        "A more resilient pound for a more resilient economy.",
        "**Fiscal policy**",
        "Mr Deputy Speaker, sound money depends too on sound public finances.",
        "We are entering a critical phase and we must learn from the past.",
        "Every time a post-war government has embarked on public spending cuts, real spending has risen back to its previous heights within three years.",
        "And sure enough there are those today who say: ease up, spend more, borrow more.",
        "That would mean debt rising towards 100% GDP \u2013 undermining growth.",
        "It would be a huge mistake and we are not going to let that happen.",
        "Many Chancellors, faced with a recovering economy and improved borrowing forecasts before an election, would be tempted to squander the gains.",
        "I will not do that today.",
        "These gains were hard won by the British people \u2013 and we\u2019re not going to jeopardise their economic security.",
        "Britain is not going back to square one.",
        "So in this Budget all decisions are paid for. Taxes are lower but so too is spending.",
        "For we must bring our national debt substantially down.",
        "Analysis published today shows just running a balanced current budget does not secure that.",
        "Instead, Britain needs to run an absolute surplus in good years.",
        "We will fix the roof when the sun is shining \u2013 to protect Britain from future storms.",
        "So I can confirm that in addition to the cuts this year and next, there will be cuts in the next Parliament too.",
        "To lock in our country\u2019s commitment to this path of deficit reduction we will seek the support of Parliament in a vote.",
        "And I will bring forward a new Charter for Budget Responsibility this autumn.",
        "We are taking further difficult decisions now so we can reduce the deficit and protect our NHS and schools and meet our obligations to the world\u2019s poorest by contributing 0.7% of our national income to help them.",
        "On public service pensions, we implement the reforms proposed by John Hutton.",
        "We will ensure schemes are properly valued, saving the taxpayer over \u00a31 billion a year.",
        "We are continuing with pay restraint in the public sector \u2013 an essential part of maintaining sound finances and economic stability.",
        "We will also insist on the prudent management of departmental finances.",
        "Thanks to the efforts of my colleagues in Cabinet, these now regularly come in under budget.",
        "In order to lock-in these underspends, I said in December that we would reduce spending by \u00a31 billion in 2015-16. Today, I am making that overall billion pound reduction permanent.",
        "And I look forward to the work my excellent colleague the Chief Secretary is now doing, with the Cabinet Office, to find further efficiencies.",
        "Difficult decisions on public service pay and pensions.",
        "Further savings in departments.",
        "A cap on welfare bills.",
        "None of these decisions are easy, but they are the right thing to ensure Britain lives within her means.",
        "**Welfare**",
        "We set out today the details of that welfare cap \u2013 and we will seek the support of Parliament for it next week.",
        "From housing benefit to tax credits, the full list of benefits included in the cap is published in the Budget document today.",
        "Only the State Pension and the cyclical unemployment benefits are excluded.",
        "I am setting it at \u00a3119 billion in 2015-16. It will rise, but only in line with forecast inflation, to \u00a3127 billion in 2018-19.",
        "Britain should always be proud of having a welfare system that helps those most in need.",
        "But never again should we allow its costs to spiral out of control and its incentives to become so distorted that it pays not to work.",
        "In future, any government that wants to spend more on benefits will: have to be honest with the public about the costs, need the approval of Parliament, and will be held to account by this permanent cap on welfare.",
        "**Tax avoidance**",
        "Mr Deputy Speaker,",
        "The distributional analysis published today shows that the Budget decisions, and the decisions across this parliament, mean the rich are making the biggest contribution to the reduction of the deficit \u2013 because we are all in this together.",
        "The independent statistics show that under this government income inequality is at its lowest level for 28 years.",
        "Thanks to my Right Honourable Friend the Prime Minister\u2019s leadership we have driven the international efforts to develop tough, new global tax rules that stop rich individuals hiding their tax and companies shifting their profits offshore.",
        "Here at home we\u2019re collecting twice as much as before through compliance \u2013 collecting the taxes that are due.",
        "And the number of registered tax avoidance schemes has fallen by half.",
        "And while the vast majority of wealthy people pay their taxes, there is still a small minority who do not.",
        "We will now require those who have signed up to disclosed tax avoidance schemes to pay their taxes, like everyone else, up front.",
        "This will apply in future to schemes covered by our General Anti-Abuse Rule too.",
        "If people feel they\u2019ve been wronged, they can of course go to court. If they win, they get their money back with interest.",
        "We have already consulted on this idea \u2013 now we will implement it. The OBR confirm that this will bring forward \u00a34 billion of tax receipts. And it will fundamentally reduce the incentive to engage in tax avoidance in the future.",
        "The public tolerance for those who do not pay their fair share evaporated long ago \u2013 but we\u2019ve had to wait for this government before there was proper action.",
        "So today we go further still:",
        "I am increasing HMRC\u2019s budget to tackle non-compliance.",
        "We will block transfers of profits between companies within groups to avoid tax.",
        "We will increase tax credit debt recovery rates for those with sufficient earnings.",
        "We will give HMRC modern powers to collect debts from bank accounts of people who can afford to pay but have repeatedly refused to, like most other Western countries.",
        "We will increase compliance checks to catch migrants who claim benefits they aren\u2019t entitled to, saving the taxpayer almost \u00a3100 million.",
        "We will take action to curb potential misuse of the EIS and VCT schemes.",
        "And we are expanding the new tax we introduced to stop people avoiding stamp duty by owning homes through a company.",
        "We will expand the tax on residential properties worth over \u00a32 million to those worth more than \u00a3500,000.",
        "And from midnight tonight anyone purchasing residential property worth over half a million pounds through a corporate envelope will be required to pay 15% stamp duty.",
        "None of this applies to homes that are rented out.",
        "Many of these are empty properties held in corporate envelopes to avoid stamp duty.",
        "This abuse will end.",
        "Mr Deputy Speaker,",
        "Another abuse has been the manipulation of the LIBOR rate.",
        "Our regulators are broadening their investigation to the foreign exchange markets \u2013 and I will keep the House informed.",
        "Financial services are a hugely important industry to this country which I want to promote around the world.",
        "But I also want the fines paid by those who have demonstrated the worst of values to support those who demonstrate the best of British values.",
        "I\u2019m talking about the men and women in our armed forces who risk their lives to keep us free.",
        "So I will continue to direct the use of the LIBOR fines to our military charities and our emergency service charities too.",
        "Because the sums continue to grow, I can today extend that support to our search and rescue and lifeboat services \u2013 and provide \u00a310 million of support to our scouts, guides, cadets and St John\u2019s Ambulance.",
        "I am also today waiving inheritance tax for those in our emergency services who give their lives protecting us.",
        "I will also relieve the VAT on fuel for our Air Ambulances and Inshore Rescue boat services across Britain, and provide a new air ambulance for London \u2013 all in response to huge and heartfelt public demand and the campaigning of my Hon. Friends for Hexham, Brentford & Isleworth, and Argyll & Bute.",
        "Tomorrow is the 21st anniversary of the IRA bomb that killed young Tim Parry and Johnathan Ball.",
        "Survivors for Peace was set up by Tim\u2019s parents, Colin and Wendy, and it no longer receives lottery funding. My Honourable Friend for Warrington South and the RHM for Dulwich have both raised this issue, and I know myself what incredible work they do.",
        "To honour the memory of all victims of terrorism we will provide the funding the programme needs.",
        "Last month with my Right Honourable Friend for Dumfriesshire I visited Lockerbie to pay my respects on the twenty fifth anniversary of the tragedy. And we will support the scholarships created for local people there to study in the United States.",
        "Further, this summer, many services of remembrance will be held in our cathedrals to mark the Great War, so we are providing \u00a320 million to support the repairs needed to these historic buildings.",
        "We will also support the celebration of the 800th anniversary of the signing of the Magna Carta next year.",
        "King John\u2019s humbling centuries ago seems unimaginably distant.",
        "A weak leader, who had risen to the top \u2013 after betraying his brother, compelled by a gang of unruly barons to sign on the dotted line.",
        "So I will provide a grant to the Magna Carta Trust to ensure that today\u2019s generation learn the lessons of the past.",
        "**Exports**",
        "Mr Deputy Speaker,",
        "We\u2019re not going to have a secure economic future if Britain doesn\u2019t earn its way in the world.",
        "We need our businesses to export more, build more, invest more and manufacture more.",
        "First, exports.",
        "Our exports have grown each year and the OBR today forecast rising export growth in the future.",
        "Our combined goods exports to Brazil, India and China have risen faster than those of our competitors.",
        "But we\u2019re starting from a low base and we\u2019ve got many lost years to catch up.",
        "Britain has to up its game \u2013 and today we do.",
        "With Stephen Green, and now Ian Livingston, we\u2019re expanding the reach and support UKTI offers British businesses.",
        "But for many firms the truth is you can only win the contract if you are backed by competitive export finance.",
        "For decades the British government has been the last port of call, when we should be backing British businesses wanting to sell abroad.",
        "Today we fundamentally change that.",
        "And we\u2019re going to start with the finance we provide our exporters.",
        "We will double the amount of lending available to \u00a33 billion.",
        "And I can announce that from today the interest rates we charge on that lending will be cut by a third.",
        "Instead of having the least competitive export finance in Europe.",
        "We will have the most competitive.",
        "We will also reform Air Passenger Duty to end the crazy system where you pay less tax travelling to Hawaii than you do travelling to China or India.",
        "It hits exports, puts off tourists and creates a great sense of injustice among our Caribbean and South Asian communities here in Britain.",
        "From next year, all long haul flights will carry the same, lower, band B tax rate that you now pay to fly to the United States.",
        "Private jets were not taxed at all under the previous government. Today they are, and I\u2019m increasing the charge so they pay more.",
        "And because we want all parts of our country to see better links with the markets of the future we\u2019re going to provide start-up support for new routes from regional airports, like Liverpool, Leeds or indeed Inverness.",
        "More support for businesses; competitive finance; cheaper global flights\u2026",
        "I want the message to go out that we are backing our exporters \u2013 so that wherever you are around the world you can\u2019t fail to see: Made in Britain.",
        "One key British export is the North Sea\u2019s oil and gas.",

        "It\u2019s why we\u2019re funding regeneration of some of the urban housing estates that are in the worst condition, and we\u2019re extending the current Support for Mortgage Interest Scheme to 2016.",
        "And it\u2019s why we\u2019ve got Help to Buy.",

        "We\u2019re the first government to have committed to long term and rising capital budgets \u2013 and this autumn I will set out the detailed plans for the projects that will be supported for the rest of the decade.

        "This generous allowance was due to expire at the end of this year \u2013 and all the business groups have urged me to extend it.",
        "So we will. But we\u2019ll do more.",
        "We\u2019re going to double the Investment Allowance to \u00a3500,000, extend it to the end of 2015, and start it next month.",
        "99.8% of businesses will get a 100% investment allowance.",
        "Almost every business across Britain will pay no upfront tax when they invest in the future.",
        "It costs \u00a32 billion in the short term \u2013 so when we say: we\u2019re going to get Britain investing; when we say we\u2019re going to back growth around the country \u2013 we mean it.",
        "**Manufacturing**",
        "A resilient economy is a more balanced economy with more exports, more building, more investment \u2013 and more manufacturing too.",

        "I\u2019ll tell you why.",
        "US industrial energy prices are half those in Britain.",
        "We need to cut our energy costs.",
        "We\u2019re going to do this by investing in new sources of energy: new nuclear power, renewables, and a shale gas revolution.",
        "We\u2019re going to do this by promoting energy efficiency.",
        "Today, by tilting the playing field \u2013 extending the 2% increase in company car tax in 2017-18 and 2018-19 while increasing the discount for ultra low emission vehicles \u2013 and reducing the rate of fuel duty on methanol.",
        "But above all we are going to have a \u00a37 billion package to cut energy bills for British manufacturers \u2013 with benefits for families and other businesses too.",
        "First, I am capping the Carbon Price Support rate at \u00a318 per ton of CO2 from 2016-17 for the rest of the decade.",
        "This will save a mid-sized manufacturer almost \u00a350,000 on their annual energy bill.",
        "And it will save families \u00a315 a year on their bills too \u2013 over and above the \u00a350 we\u2019ve already taken off.",
        "Second, I\u2019m extending the existing compensation scheme for energy intensive industries for a further four years to 2019-20.",
        "Our steel makers, chemical plants, paper mills and other heavy energy users make up 35% of our manufacturing exports and employ half a million people. This scheme helps the companies most at risk of leaving to remain in the UK.",
        "Third, I\u2019m introducing new compensation worth almost a billion pounds to protect these energy intensive manufacturers from the rising costs of the Renewable Obligation and the Feed-In Tariffs.",
        "Otherwise green levies and taxes will make up over a third of their energy bills by the end of the decade.",
        "Fourth, I am exempting from the carbon price floor the electricity from Combined Heat and Power plants which hundreds of manufacturers use.",
        "And this entire package delivered without any reduction in the investment in renewable energy.",
        "Today I have cut the cost of manufacturing in Britain.",
        "Half of the firms that will benefit most are in the north of England. A third are in Scotland and Wales.",
        "Thousands of good jobs protected.",
        "A more resilient economy.",
        "A government on the side of manufacturers.",
        "A Britain that makes things again.",
        "**Duties**",
        "So we\u2019re backing exports, backing manufacturing, backing a Britain that builds.",
        "And Mr Deputy Speaker, we also want to help hardworking people keep more of what they earn and of what they save.",
        "That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done by freezing council tax, freezing fuel duty and raising the personal allowance to \u00a310,000.",
        "And from next year tax free childcare \u2013 20% off, for up to \u00a310,000 of childcare costs for parents.",
        "And an early years pupil premium to help the most disadvantaged.",
        "Today we can do more to help.",
        "Let me start with duties.",
        "I can confirm that the fuel duty rise planned for September will not take place.",
        "Petrol will be 20 pence lower per litre than it would have been.",
        "Turning to gambling duties.",
        "Fixed odds betting terminals have proliferated since gambling laws were liberalised almost a decade ago.",
        "These machines are highly lucrative, and therefore it\u2019s right we now raise the duty on them to 25%.",
        "We will also extend the horserace betting levy to bookmakers who are based offshore.",
        "And we\u2019ll look at wider levy reform and at introducing a \u2018racing right\u2019 to support the sport.",
        "While betting machines have grown, the number of bingo halls has plummetted by three quarters over the last thirty years.",
        "Yet bingo duty has been set at the high rate of 20%.",
        "Now fuel duty is frozen, my Honourable Friend for Harlow has turned his energy and talent into a vigorous campaign to cut bingo duty \u2013 ably assisted by my Honourable Friend for Waveney.",
        "They want the rate cut to 15%.",
        "I can go further.",
        "Bingo duty will be halved to 10% to protect jobs and protect communities.",
        "Let me turn now to tobacco and alcohol duties.",
        "Tobacco duty has been rising by 2% above inflation and will do so again today.",
        "This escalator was due to end next year \u2013 but there are no sound health reasons to end it, so it will be extended for the rest of the next Parliament.",
        "We\u2019ve introduced new laws to prevent alcohol being sold below minimum tax rates, and this helps prevent supermarkets undercutting pubs, and helps stop problem drinking.",
        "It\u2019s a far more targeted approach than the alcohol duty escalator hated by many responsible drinkers.",
        "Today, I am scrapping that escalator for all alcohol duties.",
        "They will rise with inflation, with these exceptions:",
        "Scottish Whisky is a huge British success story.",
        "To support that industry, instead of raising duties on whisky and other spirits, I am today going to freeze them.",
        "And with some cider makers in the West Country hit hard by the recent weather, I am going to help them by freezing the duty on ordinary cider too.",
        "And then there\u2019s beer. I know the industry, led so ably by my Honourable Friend for Burton, have been campaigning for a freeze.",
        "But beer duty next week will not be frozen.",
        "It will be cut again by 1 pence.",
        "Pubs saved. Jobs created. A penny off a pint for the second year running.",
        "**Personal allowance**",
        "Mr Deputy Speaker, it is a central part of our long term economic plan that people keep more of the money they have earned.",
        "When we came to office, the personal tax allowance was just \u00a36,500.",
        "In less than three weeks time, it will reach \u00a310,000.",
        "That\u2019s an income tax cut for 25 million people.",
        "Today, because we are working through our plan, we can afford to go further.",
        "Next year there will be no income tax at all on the first \u00a310,500 of your salary.",
        "Ten and a half thousand pounds tax free.",
        "\u00a3800 less in tax every year for the typical taxpayer.",
        "Our increases in the personal allowance will have lifted over 3 million of the lowest paid out of income tax altogether.",
        "And I am incredibly proud we have achieved that.",
        "I can also confirm today that the higher rate threshold will rise for the first time this Parliament, from \u00a341,450 to \u00a341,865 next month, and then by a further 1% to \u00a342,285 next year.",
        "And because I am also passing the full benefit of today\u2019s personal allowance increase on to higher rate taxpayers \u2013 people earning 42,000, 43, 50, 60, all the way up to \u00a3100,000 will be paying less income tax because of this Budget.",
        "Tax cuts for those on low incomes \u2013 and those on middle incomes too.",
        "Help for hardworking people as part of a long term economic plan.",
        "And I am linking the rate of the transferable tax allowance for married couples to the personal allowance, so it will also rise to \u00a31,050.",
        "Help for 4 million families that they would take away and we are proud to provide.",
        "**Savings**",
        "Our tax changes will help people who work. But there is a large group who have had a particularly hard time in recent years: and that is savers.",
        "And this matters not just because these are people who have made sacrifices to provide for their own economic security in retirement.",
        "It matters too because one of the biggest weaknesses of the British economy is that it borrows too much and saves too little.",
        "This has been a problem for decades and we can\u2019t fix it overnight.",
        "It\u2019s no surprise that the OBR forecast the saving ratio falling.",
        "So today we put in place policies for savers that stand alongside deficit reduction as a centrepiece of our long term economic plan.",
        "The reforms I am about to announce are only possible because, thanks to this government:",
        "\u2013 we have a triple lock on the state pension",
        "\u2013 more people are saving through auto enrolment",
        "\u2013 and we\u2019re introducing a single tier pension that will lift most people above the means test",
        "That secure basic income for pensioners means we can make far reaching changes to the tax regime to reward those who save.",
        "Here\u2019s how.",
        "First, I want to help savers by dramatically increasing the simplicity, flexibility and generosity of ISAs.",
        "Twenty four million people in this country have an ISA.",
        "And yet millions of them would like to save more than the annual limits of around five and a half thousand pounds on cash ISAs, and eleven and a half thousand pounds on stocks and shares ISAs. Three quarters of those who hit the cash ISA limit are basic rate taxpayers.",
        "So we will make ISAs simpler by merging the cash and stocks ISAs to create a single New ISA.",
        "We will make them more flexible by allowing savers to transfer all of the ISAs they already have from stocks and shares into cash, or the other way around.",
        "And we are going to make the New ISA more generous by increasing the annual limit to \u00a315,000.",
        "\u00a315,000 of savings a year tax free \u2013 available from the first of July.",
        "And I\u2019m raising the limits for Junior ISAs to \u00a34,000 a year too.",
        "But the \u00a315,000 New ISA is just the first thing we are doing for savers.",
        "Second, many pensioners have seen their incomes fall as a consequence of the low interest rates that Britain has deliberately pursued to support the economy.",
        "It\u2019s time Britain helped them out in return.",
        "So we will launch the new Pensioner Bond paying market leading rates.",
        "It will be issued by National Savings and Investments, open to everyone aged 65 or over, and available from January next year.",
        "The exact rates will be set in the autumn, to ensure the best possible offer \u2013 but our assumption is 2.8% for a one year bond and 4% on a three year bond.",
        "That\u2019s much better than anything equivalent in the market today.",
        "Up to \u00a310 billion of these bonds will be issued. A maximum of \u00a310,000 can be saved in each bond.",
        "That\u2019s at least a million pensioner bonds.",
        "And because 21 million people also invest in Premium Bonds I am lifting the cap for the first time in a decade from \u00a330,000 to \u00a340,000 this June, and to \u00a350,000 next year \u2013 and I will double the number of million pound winners.",
        "But I still want to do more to support saving.",
        "And so, third, we will completely change the tax treatment of defined contribution pensions to bring it into line with the modern world.",
        "There will be consequential implications for defined benefit pensions upon which we will consult and proceed cautiously.",
        "So the changes we announce will not today apply to them.",
        "But 13 million people have defined contribution schemes, and the number continues to grow.",
        "We\u2019ve introduced flexibilities.",
        "But most people still have little option but to take out an annuity, even though annuity rates have fallen by a half over the last 15 years.",
        "The tax rules around these pensions are a manifestation of a patronising view that pensioners can\u2019t be trusted with their own pension pots.",
        "I reject that.",
        "People who have worked hard and saved hard all their lives, and done the right thing, should be trusted with their own finances.",
        "And that\u2019s precisely what we will now do. Trust the people.",
        "Some changes will take effect from next week.",
        "We will:",
        "\u2013 cut the income requirement for flexible drawdown from \u00a320,000 to \u00a312,000",
        "\u2013 raise the capped drawdown limit from 120% to 150%",
        "\u2013 increase the size of the lump sum small pot five-fold to \u00a310,000",
        "\u2013 and almost double the total pension savings you can take as a lump sum to \u00a330,000",
        "All of these changes will come into effect on 27 March.",
        "These measures alone would amount to a radical change.",
        "But they are only a step in the fundamental reform of the taxation of defined contribution pensions I want to see.",
        "I am announcing today that we will legislate to remove all remaining tax restrictions on how pensioners have access to their pension pots.",
        "Pensioners will have complete freedom to draw down as much or as little of their pension pot as they want, anytime they want.",
        "No caps. No drawdown limits.",
        "Let me be clear. No one will have to buy an annuity.",
        "And we\u2019re going to introduce a new guarantee, enforced by law, that everyone who retires on these defined contribution pensions will be offered free, impartial, face-to-face advice on how to get the most from the choices they will now have.",
        "Those who still want the certainty of an annuity, as many will, will be able to shop around for the best deal.",
        "I am providing \u00a320 million over the next two years to work with consumer groups and industry to develop this new right to advice.",
        "When it comes to tax charges, it will still be possible to take a quarter of your pension pot tax free on retirement, as today.",
        "But instead of the punitive 55% tax that exists now if you try to take the rest, anything else you take out of your pension will simply be taxed at normal marginal tax rates \u2013 as with any other income. So not a 55% tax but a 20% tax for most pensioners.",
        "The OBR confirm that in the next fifteen years, as some people use these new freedoms to draw down their pensions, this tax cut will lead to an increase in tax receipts.",
        "These major changes to the tax regime require a separate Act of Parliament \u2013 and we will have them in place for April next year.",
        "Mr Deputy Speaker, what I am proposing is the most far-reaching reform to the taxation of pensions since the regime was introduced in 1921.",
        "But there is one final reform to support savings I would like to make.",
        "Mr Deputy Speaker,",
        "There is a 10 pence starting rate for income from savings.",
        "It is complex to levy and it penalises low income savers.",
        "Today I am abolishing the 10 pence rate for savers altogether.",
        "No tax on those savings whatsoever.",
        "And we will almost double this zero-pence band to cover \u00a35,000 of saving income.",
        "One and a half million low income savers of all ages will benefit.",
        "Two thirds of a million pensioners will be helped.",
        "Mr Deputy Speaker,",
        "The \u00a315,000 New ISA.",
        "The Pensioner Bond.",
        "People given access to their own pension pots.",
        "A right to impartial advice.",
        "The 10p rate for savers abolished to zero.",
        "The message from this Budget is:",
        "\u2013 you have earned it;",
        "\u2013 you have saved it;",
        "\u2013 and this government is on your side.",
        "Whether you\u2019re on a low or middle income,",
        "Whether you\u2019re saving for your home, for your family or for your retirement.",
        "We\u2019re backing a Britain that saves.",

        "The central mission of this government is to deliver economic security.",
        "We\u2019re not promising quick fixes.",
        "Instead we\u2019re taking the next steps in our long term plan.",
