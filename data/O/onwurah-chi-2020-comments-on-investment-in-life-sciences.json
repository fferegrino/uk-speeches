    "content": [
        "Investment in the life sciences is a critical part of our response to this pandemic and the health challenges we face as a nation. But our investment doesn\u2019t reflect regional science capacity or health needs as the IPPR analysis makes clear.",
        "The North receives less than half of the life science investment per head that the South of England does even though it has great teaching hospitals and significant health inequalities.",
        "We need to see that change as we invest in science to beat the pandemic and create new jobs across the country."
