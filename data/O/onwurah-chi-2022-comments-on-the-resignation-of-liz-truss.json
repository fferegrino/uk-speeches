    "content": [
        "After 12 years of Tory failure, the people of Newcastle deserve so much better than a revolving door of Conservative chaos. Mortgage payments soaring, energy prices rising and the North East becoming the child poverty capital of the country. All at the hands of the Tories.",
        "Crisis after crisis \u2013 created in Downing Street. The people of Newcastle are paying the price for Tory incompetence.",
        "The British public deserve a proper say on the country\u2019s future. We must have a chance at a fresh start. We need a General Election \u2013 now."
