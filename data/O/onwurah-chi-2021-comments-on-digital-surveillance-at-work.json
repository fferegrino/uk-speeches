    "content": [
        "Guidance and regulation to protect workers are woefully outdated in light of the accelerated move to remote working and rapid advancements in technology.",
        "The bottom line is that workers should not be digitally monitored without their informed consent, and there should be clear rules, rights and expectations for both businesses and workers.",
        "Ministers must urgently provide better regulatory oversight of online surveillance software to ensure people have the right to privacy whether in their workplace or home \u2013 which are increasingly one and the same."
