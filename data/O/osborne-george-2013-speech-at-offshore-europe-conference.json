        "Good morning.",
        "I\u2019m delighted to be here in Aberdeen at such an illustrious gathering of the oil and gas industry \u2013 an industry that is of vital importance to Britain\u2019s economy.",
        "But let us first remember Duncan Munro, Sarah Darnley, Gary McCrossan and George Allison.",
        "Four brave professionals who ten days ago, tragically lost their lives in a helicopter crash off Shetland.",
        "Our thoughts are with their families, friends and colleagues at this difficult time \u2013 and the book of condolences here today shows the depth of feeling for those four brave professionals.",
        "And we should also remember that 25 years ago, 167 people lost their lives in the Piper Alpha disaster.",
        "A tragedy that leaves an indelible mark here in Aberdeen on the industry, and the whole community.",
        "Let us pay our respects.",
        "To the brave professionals who lost their lives last month, and on that terrible night 25 years ago.",
        "To their families and friends in whose memories they live on.",
        "To those who survived and the rescue teams who helped them do so.",
        "The whole of the UK owes a massive debt to the thousands of men and women who work in what is an inherently dangerous environment \u2013 delivering enormous benefits to every family in the country.",
        "I know that as an industry you sometimes feel taken for granted.",
        "Well, I want you to know this: you are not taken for granted.",
        "You are very much appreciated.",
        "And my personal message to you is this.",
        "First, I recognize the vital role the oil and gas industry plays in the UK economy \u2013 and will continue to play for many many years to come.",
        "Second, I also recognize that the oil and gas remaining in the UK Continental Shelf will be increasingly difficult and more expensive to extract \u2013 but that this Government commits to play our part in delivering the investment that\u2019s needed.",
        "And third, I believe that the best way to support this industry and maximize the returns from this great national asset is:",
        "\u2013 by working together across the UK;",
        "\u2013 through mobilizing all the UK\u2019s resources; and  \nby pooling our risks to provide stability across the whole UK.",
        "On Sunday, I was on the Andrew Marr TV show.",
        "In his book, the History of Modern Britain, he says that the oil and gas industry\u2019s story is one of the most remarkable and under-discussed in the entire history of our country.",
        "It\u2019s a tale of pioneering geologists, seismologists, roustabouts and rough-necks.",
        "He said that: \u201cThe discovery and exploitation of huge oil and gas fields far out under cold, stormy and turbulent waters \u2026 is a modern epic of technical skill, bold finance, endurance and individual courage\u201d.",
        "And he is right to compare the feats of North Sea civil engineering with the building of the railways by the Victorians.",
        "I\u2019ll never forget my first visit to a North Sea platform, the Elgin Franklin platform, six years ago.",
        "The long helicopter flight across the bleak, open sea \u2013 and then, the pinprick in the distance of the platform looming ever larger \u2013 until you land on the enormous construction.",
        "I remember that first, powerful emotion you get when you step out onto a North Sea platform: what an extraordinary achievement of the human spirit and ingenuity.",
        "Later today I will travel out to Talisman Sinopec\u2019s Montrose platform and I know I will feel the same pride in what our country can achieve when we work together.",
        "For from the day 38 years ago, when the first oil was piped ashore in Cruden Bay, the oil and gas industry has brought huge benefits to the whole of the UK.",
        "And it continues to do so today.",
        "Oil and gas still meets around 70 per cent of the UK\u2019s primary energy needs \u2013 with more than half of UK demand for oil and gas met by UK production.",
        "The heat and light for our homes;",
        "power for our businesses;",
        "and fuel for the transport for our people and goods.",
        "Directly and indirectly, the industry employs nearly half a million people \u2013 almost half of them here in Scotland.",
        "It\u2019s the largest industrial investor in the UK \u2013 and it\u2019s investing more than ever before.",
        "And while the expertise for the initial development of the North Sea was largely imported, a world class home-grown industry has sprung up on the back of it.",
        "Over 1,000 companies in and around Aberdeen alone.",
        "Businesses which are now leading an export charge from Azerbaijan and Russia, to Brazil and the Middle East \u2013 with international sales of nearly \u00a38 billion from Scotland alone.",
        "As all of you know, subsea technology is a sector where the UK is a global leader \u2013 and it\u2019s one of our fastest growing industries.",
        "And I\u2019ve spoken to the subsea\u2019s industry conference here before in Aberdeen to celebrate its success.",
        "Today we capture more than a third of a global market \u2013 a market that\u2019s set to double over the next five years.",
        "Growth at home and abroad.",
        "Growth that I want to help you deliver.",
        "Of course, I understand that your industry has changed hugely since the early days of North Sea extraction.",
        "Then, the North Sea was dominated by a handful of \u2018majors\u2019 \u2013 the BPs and Shells, the Occidentals and Exxons.",
        "Now, there are over 50 oil companies operating in the North Sea \u2013 with smaller independents and national state-owned oil companies rubbing shoulders with the original \u2018majors\u2019.",
        "New names to conjure with: Apache, KNOC, Petrofac, Talisman, Sinopec, JX Nippon.",
        "While the pattern of ownership today has changed from 30 years ago, the nature of the development opportunities is different too.",
        "Companies are operating in a mature basin.",
        "And that brings me to my second point.",
        "The fact is that the oil and gas remaining in the UK Continental Shelf will be increasingly difficult and more expensive to extract.",
        "You know well that the \u2018big\u2019 strikes are fewer and farther between.",
        "The opportunities are often smaller, technically challenging or both \u2013 with the oil either in deeper waters or just harder to reach and extract.",
        "In the central North Sea, companies are drilling at water depths of 100 metres.",
        "In the planned Rosebank field West of Shetland, Chevron will be operating at 1,100 metres in waters more than ten times deeper.",
        "New entrants are bringing fresh thinking and impetus, making viable even the most marginal fields.",
        "Normally when politicians visit platforms, they visit the newest field.",
        "But the Montrose field I\u2019ll be visiting is one of the oldest in the North Sea.",
        "I\u2019ve deliberately chosen to go there because I want to see how Talisman Sinopec and Marubeni Oil and Gas\u2019s \u00a31.6 billion investment is extending the life of five fields by 14 years \u2013 which means that these fields will be producing the equivalent of an additional 100 million barrels of oil until 2030.",
        "This project alone will be creating and securing 2,000 jobs throughout the UK supply chain. But there are also challenges.",
        "We need to develop a North Sea regime that keeps pace with the changing structure of the basin.",
        "The Montrose project is a case in point.",
        "Its economic viability depends on a complex mix of factors: targeted tax breaks, and bundling a number of older fields with two undeveloped ones.",
        "So, as we think about the future of the North Sea, what can we be certain about?",
        "We can be certain that:",
        "\u2013 our reserves aren\u2019t infinite;",
        "\u2013 the costs of extraction are rising;",
        "\u2013 and North Sea tax revenues are in long-term decline.",
        "But we can also be certain that the ingenuity of the industry will secure its long-term future and that we\u2019ll still be recovering oil from the North Sea and West of Shetland in the 2050s.",
        "We can\u2019t know the precise level of recoverable reserves.",
        "The future is about volume and value.",
        "So nothing can \u2013 or should \u2013 be taken for granted \u2013 and we know that.",
        "The British government\u2019s objective is simple: we want to work with you to maximise the North Sea\u2019s recoverable reserves.",
        "So we\u2019ve put in the place the first ever national Oil and Gas strategy.",
        "The PILOT programme is identifying ways to remove barriers to development.",
        "And, working through the Fiscal Forum, we\u2019re putting in place tax reliefs to support the industry as extraction becomes more difficult.",
        "In my Budgets, I\u2019ve doubled the value and extended the scope of the small field allowance.",
        "I\u2019ve put in place a \u00a33 billion allowance to support investment in and exploration of large and deep fields like those West of Shetland.",
        "And I\u2019ve introduced a \u00a3500 million allowance for large shallow-water gas fields and a brownfield allowance to encourage incremental investment in older fields.",
        "Perhaps most important of all, I\u2019ve provided the industry with long-term stability, by providing certainty on tax reliefs \u2013 worth upwards of \u00a320 billion over a 30-year period \u2013 on future decommissioning costs.",
        "Funded by the whole of the UK, that\u2019s equivalent to \u00a33000 pounds for every man woman and child in Scotland \u2013 being used to support investment in the North Sea.",
        "The UK government will enter into contracts with industry setting out what relief companies can expect to receive in future when decommissioning assets.",
        "And if the actual amount turns out to be less, the government will make up the short-fall.",
        "This means assets will be easier to transfer and the climate for investment improved.",
        "I can tell this Conference today I\u2019m unveiling the final decommissioning deed.",
        "A concrete example of the tax certainty this government is providing.",
        "Never before has any government entered into legally binding contracts with individual companies to guarantee the tax relief they can expect decades into the future.",
        "No other place in the world provides such a guarantee.",
        "And your industry \u2013 not the Treasury \u2013 estimates that this decommissioning certainty will drive at least \u00a317 billion of increased investment, extending the life of the North Sea basin with an additional 1.7 billion barrels extracted.",
        "It\u2019s the culmination of 18 months of hard work and close collaboration between you and government.",
        "Thank you for that.",
        "Now let\u2019s get the deeds signed and get the investment.",
        "And we\u2019re already seeing results from this new tax regime.",
        "Oil & Gas UK are forecasting record levels of investment of \u00a313.5 billion for 2013, helping to stem the decline in production of recent years.",
        "And look at the projects already announced.",
        "Statoil are investing \u00a34.3 billion in the Mariner heavy oil project, creating 700 jobs.",
        "EnQuest, the UK\u2019s largest independent oil producer are investing \u00a3170 million in the Thistle field, safeguarding 500 jobs and creating nearly 1,000 more in the supply chain.",
        "CNR International are investing \u00a3300 million to extend the life of Ninian field and produce 5 million additional barrels.",
        "And following the introduction of the large shallow water gas field allowance, GDF Suez, Centrica and BayernGas UK are investing \u00a31.4bn in the Cygnus gas field, creating 1,200 jobs.",
        "We want to build on this success.",
        "Sir Ian Wood is currently reviewing how we can improve future economic recovery of oil and gas from the UK Continental Shelf.",
        "He is looking at what further powers the government should have to ensure the North Sea remains a prime location for new investment and that government ensures companies are operating their licences effectively.",
        "Government and industry have a shared interest in maximizing the economic production of the UK\u2019s oil and gas reserves.",
        "I want to see far greater collaboration from industry on production and exploration.",
        "Because the fact is, production efficiency is down.",
        "When ownership of North Sea assets is more widely spread than ever before, collaboration is often the only way to improve the economic viability through economies of scale.",
        "Like:",
        "Access to critical infrastructure.",
        "Keeping in play older infrastructure hubs, so that recoverable reserves aren\u2019t lost forever.",
        "Sharing the benefits of new technologies and extraction methods.",
        "Above all, deploying the best talent to the North Sea so the basin can flourish.",
        "Government and industry pulling together to maximise both of our returns from the North Sea \u2013 volume and value.",
        "Let me turn to the bigger picture on energy.",
        "Your message, which we\u2019ve heard and listened to, is the need for predictability so you can plan for the long-term.",
        "That\u2019s what our decommissioning tax certainty is all about.",
        "But this is just one part of our support to the energy market.",
        "We are seeking, from companies like yours and others, tens of billions of pounds of investment to secure Britain\u2019s energy in the decades to come.",
        "And we want a mix \u2013 oil and gas are vital, but so too are renewables and nuclear.",
        "My ambition is that when you look across the western world, you see the UK as the best and most stable place to invest \u2013 and we\u2019re creating the tax and regulatory regime to achieve it.",
        "Last year, we published our Gas Strategy which set out our expectation that gas generation will be an essential part of our energy supply.",
        "In June, we published draft strike prices for renewable energy generation \u2013 providing the certainty needed to make investing in new technologies less risky and more attractive.",
        "We\u2019re introducing ambitious and radical reforms to the electricity market \u2013 a new way of paying for generation will bring forward up to \u00a3110 billion of private sector energy investment.",
        "We\u2019ve set up a Green Investment Bank to invest in green energy projects and leverage further investment from the private sector.",
        "We\u2019ve already committed to invest up to \u00a33.8 billion through the Bank.",
        "On Shale, let me say this, because I know it\u2019s an issue that has been in the news a lot recently.",
        "Of course, we want exploration of our shale resources to be safe, to avoid environmental damage, and be done in a way where communities get the benefit of what\u2019s happening in their backyard.",
        "That\u2019s why we got the industry to commit to generous community benefits.",
        "But let me also say this.",
        "Britain led the way in finding new sources of energy \u2013 coal in the 18th and 19th centuries, oil in the 20th century, and renewables at the turn of the 21st century.",
        "If we turn our back on new sources of energy which countries like China and the US are exploiting, then:",
        "\u2013 we\u2019re saying to British families: you pay energy bills that are higher than those paid by families elsewhere;",
        "\u2013 we\u2019re saying to British companies: you\u2019ll face costs higher than companies face elsewhere;",
        "\u2013 and we\u2019re saying to our country: we\u2019ll have fewer jobs, less investment and higher costs of living \u2013 and I\u2019m not prepared to say that to the British people.",
        "Britain is not going to turn its back on the energy sources of the future.",
        "So we\u2019ve set out a generous new tax regime for shale gas and removed the bureaucratic obstacles to its use onshore and offshore.",
        "And when I talk about Britain I mean a United Kingdom.",
        "I\u2019ve talked about predictability in this speech, but I know that one issue that has created uncertainty is the possibility of Scottish independence.",
        "We determined to end that uncertainty by holding a referendum that will reach a decisive outcome next year.",
        "The question of whether Scotland\u2019s future lies within the UK or without needs to be answered.",
        "As an Englishman, I passionately hope people in Scotland vote to stay within the UK in just over a year\u2019s time.",
        "This hope is, I know, shared by the great majority of people living in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
        "The reason is simple: we\u2019re better together.",
        "For those tempted to think that the rest of the UK would be better off without Scotland, let me be clear.",
        "Separation would bring consequences for not just Scotland.",
        "We would all suffer.",
        "The rest of the UK is by far the most important market for Scottish goods and services.",
        "Scotland\u2019s trade with the rest of the UK is almost double its entire trade with the rest of the world \u2013 and it\u2019s a share that\u2019s growing.",
        "This trade benefits companies and employees the length and breadth of Scotland.",
        "And it\u2019s a two-way street: Scotland benefits from being a strong part of the UK, and the UK also benefits from Scotland\u2019s place within it.",
        "As our economy recovers, I want Scotland to lead the way.",
        "All achieved within the UK, not outside.",
        "So let\u2019s lay to rest some myths once and for all.",
        "Independent European countries of similar size don\u2019t out-perform Scotland.",
        "In fact, Scotland performs well against comparable European States.",
        "Introducing an international border between Scotland and the rest of the UK would reduce business and trade across the border.",
        "You don\u2019t need passport controls and customs officers for there to be a negative effect.",
        "It\u2019s the gradual growing apart of institutions, policies and regulations;",
        "It\u2019s the slow unpicking of the unified labour market, an integrated infrastructure and a single tax system \u2013 the possibility of different currencies.",
        "Today, we\u2019re publishing clear analysis that shows the value of Scotland being part of the UK, in terms of extra trade and economic activity over the coming generation.",
        "As the paper says: Scottish GDP could be 4 per cent higher in 30 years if it is part of the UK. \u00a32000 for every family in Scotland.",
        "Put it another way: separate from the UK, create an international border, and the loss to every Scottish household will be \u00a32000.",
        "So, we should think very hard before Scotland exchanges a UK domestic market that works well for a new foreign export market that won\u2019t work as well.",
        "If it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t break it.",
        "Your industry is a great example of how we\u2019re better together when we work together, when we are together.",
        "Oil & Gas UK talk about the \u201cneed for fiscal predictability and long-term planning to optimize recovery of the country\u2019s offshore oil and gas resource\u201d.",
        "Today all of the major tax revenues, whether it\u2019s from oil, or retail, or consumption, or income or duties are pooled across the UK.",
        "This provides Scotland with secure and stable funding; the Scottish government with budgetary predictability and Scotland\u2019s public services with the stability to plan for the long-term.",
        "As part of the UK, Scotland doesn\u2019t have to cope with the challenge of managing volatile oil revenues.",
        "This is no small challenge \u2013 Scottish tax revenues from oil can fluctuate from year to year from \u00a32 billion to \u00a312 billion.",
        "They are the most volatile tax revenues that exist.",
        "Finance ministries are always at risk of being over optimistic about how much revenue they\u2019re going to get in.",
        "That\u2019s why we created the Office for Budget Responsibility.",
        "It is totally independent.",
        "And it now provides for us independent estimates of tax revenues \u2013 including from oil and gas.",
        "So when you hear big numbers bandied about that aren\u2019t impartial, and it sounds too good to be true \u2013 it probably is.",
        "The UK government can provide the oil and gas industry with a long-term commitment to decommissioning relief.",
        "This commitment represents around 1 per cent of UK GDP.",
        "It would represent around 12 per cent of Scottish GDP.",
        "It\u2019s for the Scottish government to explain how they would pay for that.",
        "The UK\u2019s approach looks at the wider economic contribution of oil and gas, not just at tax revenues.",
        "We\u2019ve been prepared to take the long-term decisions needed to unlock investment.",
        "We accept that\u2019s cost us in lower tax receipts in the short term \u2013 but its worth it for the benefits over the long haul.",
        "We\u2019ve been able to pursue this course because the UK has broad shoulders \u2013 a big domestic market, a diverse economy, a wide tax base and a broad energy mix.",
        "Look at the facts.",
        "Oil and gas is an important national asset, but revenues from oil and gas are just 2 per cent of our total tax receipts.",
        "Renewable energy is an increasingly important part of the energy mix.",
        "Many of the companies represented here today are also leaders in renewable energy.",
        "Last year over \u00a31.5 billion was invested to develop Scotland\u2019s abundant sources of renewable energy, which now supports over 11,000 jobs and generates nearly 40 per cent of Scotland\u2019s electricity.",
        "This is made possible by over \u00a3500 million a year of UK support, with the costs spread amongst 26 million households across the UK, keeping average electricity bills in Scotland lower than they would be if funded by Scottish consumers alone.",
        "How likely is it that this kind of subsidy would be provided to the energy market of a foreign country?",
        "As I\u2019ve said many times before, Scotland could go it alone.",
        "But to suggest that spending can be increased; tax bills cut; an oil fund established; household energy bills kept down and investment in renewables increased simply doesn\u2019t add up.",
        "Texans played an important part in the early exploration of the North Sea.",
        "So you\u2019ll recognise the well-known Texan phrase \u2013 \u201call hat and no cattle\u201d.",
        "I hope those who advocate Scottish independence will offer a little less hat and a bit more cattle.",
        "Let me end by saying this.",
        "How we manage our country\u2019s natural resources goes to the heart of the solidarity between the peoples and nations of these islands.",
        "Whether we are realising the assets from the dark waters of the North Sea or West of Shetland, or shale gas reserves in Lancashire, or coal in Yorkshire or renewable energy in the Thames Estuary and the Firth of Forth.",
        "You have my total commitment to your remarkable industry.",
        "I will work with you to get the tax regime right, to support more investment, to create the climate for more production and more jobs.",
        "My door is always open to hear what you have to say and to help you.",
        "Volume and value.",
        "Valuable and valued.",
        "We know that when we:",
        "\u2013 pool our resources",
        "\u2013 share our advantages",
        "\u2013 and join forces to tackle future challenges",
        "\u2013 we achieve far more by working together",
        "Industry and government.",
        "Scotland and Britain.",
        "The whole is so much greater than the sum of the parts.",
        "Thank you."
