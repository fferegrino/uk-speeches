    "summary": "Below is the text of the speech made by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, at the 2011 Liberal Democrat Party conference.",
    "content": [
        "I\u2019d like to tell you about a man who\u2019s been a great source of inspiration and guidance to me behind the scenes over the last year.",
        "Gordon.",
        "Although outwardly dour, his finely tuned political antennae and no nonsense style make him the perfect sounding board.",
        "He\u2019s not flash \u2013 he\u2019s just Gordon. Gordon Birtwistle, the Liberal Democrat MP for Burnley. One of the most talented and tenacious of our 2010 intake. I\u2019m privileged he agreed to be my PPS.",
        "Alistair Darling wasn\u2019t quite so keen on his Gordon.",
        "His Gordon racked up a record deficit fuelled by irresponsible and unsustainable spending.",
        "His Gordon denied any responsibility for the economic woes caused by his own policies.",
        "His Gordon \u201cunleashed the forces of hell\u201d simply for sharing his views on the severity of the economic crisis.",
        "Who was feeding Gordon Brown such advice? Was it Mandy? Or McBride? I think it\u2019s pretty obvious \u2013 it was all Balls.",
        "Unlike Labour, our party has never shied away from telling difficult truths on the economy:",
        "Vince Cable led the way in warning of the dangers that were building.",
        "And we made a historic decision last Spring. When we signed up to coalition government, we knew our country\u2019s economic stability depended on it.",
        "Returning our country to lasting prosperity is the founding purpose of this Government \u2013 the overwhelming national interest that motivated two very different political parties to take responsibility together for a full 5 years.",
        "We resolved to act in the national interest and put our country first. That is what we\u2019re doing.",
        "\u201cIn government, on your side\u201d doesn\u2019t mean telling people there\u2019s an easy answer to the horrendous problems Labour left.",
        "It means telling it straight.",
        "To get things right for the long term, we must stick to our guns now.",
        "And we shouldn\u2019t forget the impact of our unity and our resolve.",
        "Concern about both sovereign debt and economic growth is at the heart of the current market turbulence.",
        "Turbulence fuelled by uncertainty about the ability of political leaders across the globe to take the decisive action their countries need.",
        "Since we came into office, our coalition Government has taken the difficult, and sometimes unpopular decisions necessary to fix our economy.",
        "This decisive action has made an immediate impact.",
        "Interest rates have stayed low, keeping workers in their jobs and families in their homes.",
        "Fellow Liberal Democrats, we played a decisive role in securing our country\u2019s financial credibility. This should make us proud.",
        "We have built a strong shelter, but the storm is still raging.",
        "Elsewhere in Europe, the struggle to establish credible deficit reduction plans goes on. In the US, political deadlock brought a historic downgrade of the country\u2019s credit rating.",
        "Yet despite all the evidence, the party that put us in this hole just want to keep digging.",
        "Labour say our motivation is dogmatic. They\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s practical.",
        "Financial discipline is necessary for effective government. It would be completely wrong to leave the bills for past mistakes to be paid for by our children. The economic case is indisputable \u2013 that\u2019s what so many of you have done in local government, and that\u2019s what we must continue to do in central government. We must stick to our plans and we will.",
        "We\u2019ll be straight with people: about how long this will take; how hard it will be, and what we will do to get it right.",
        "A huge deficit, an unbalanced economy, our trading partners in real difficultly.",
        "These are very big problems. Solving them will take years, and every one of us has a role to play. To support growth, to help families under pressure.",
        "As Liberal Democrats, our judgements about what needs to be done should be driven by the liberal economy we want to build.",
        "A liberal economy shaped by free and open competition,",
        "A liberal economy built on long-term investment, not debt and waste.",
        "A liberal economy where growth is shared across the country",
        "A liberal economy where taxation delivers fairness.",
        "Sustainable, balanced, competitive, fair. To get the kind of growth we want, we must break down the vested interests \u2013 the enemies of growth that stand in the way of future prosperity.",
        "We are prepared to take them on. We will name and shame those standing in the way of that central national purpose.",
        "Free trade has been a liberal rallying call for centuries. Offering gains to countries around the world and especially for Britain, with our quality exports and trading history.",
        "Today our trade policy is being brilliantly led by Ed Davey.",
        "The inception of the European single market a quarter of a century ago helped create hundreds of thousands of new jobs.",
        "Astonishingly, the single market is not yet complete. Huge areas of the European economy are still not fully open to British firms \u2013 especially in the services and energy sectors",
        "Completing this work will support growth, jobs and competitiveness not just in Britain but across the whole of Europe.",
        "There\u2019s an opportunity for Britain to lead this agenda right now \u2013 as we did so successfully in the 1980s.",
        "As the Eurozone seeks to deepen its integration \u2013 and we need it to do so more quickly \u2013 they will need our support. And they will get it.",
        "Sadly, eurosceptics on left and right still fail to understand Winston Churchill\u2019s insight that sharing sovereignty strengthens our influence and isolation weakens us. Scottish Nationalists make the same mistake.",
        "We\u2019ll never let the anti-European isolationists or nationalists frustrate our national interest.",
        "They are enemies of growth.",
        "Fortunately, coalition ministers are united in pursuing a policy of practical, pragmatic engagement in the EU.",
        "Nick Clegg and I are working with David Cameron and George Osborne to make deepening, strengthening, and deregulating the single market a central aim of Britain\u2019s European policy \u2013 because it will bring jobs and growth.",
        "Too many businesses are being held back by congested roads, slow railways, inadequate broadband.",
        "At the spending review last year, we looked at infrastructure spending in the round, picking only the most economically valuable projects from across government for funding.",
        "And as a result, we\u2019re investing more in the transport network over these 4 years than Labour managed in the last 4. The redevelopment of New Street Station here in Birmingham, the Mersey gateway bridge, Crossrail in London, and a national high speed rail network.",
        "And we have prioritised the money to invest to make sure that high speed broadband gets to every part of the country.",
        "Now more than ever, we need to get on with this work.",
        "But there\u2019s a major vested interest in the way. Bureaucracy, rules and red tape that mean it takes years to get things done. A planning system that can take more than a decade to allow even modest developments to go forward.",
        "It has to change. And under the coalition it will.",
        "I know there are concerns about our planning reforms. So it\u2019s important to understand what we\u2019re really doing. The presumption of sustainable development is right because it establishes the right balance.",
        "Local communities in the driving seat, local protections in place and yes more local homes and local jobs.",
        "So while it is politically contentious \u2013 we will reform planning.",
        "As Chief Secretary, I set the rules that control public spending. Mostly, that\u2019s about making sure we stick within our budget, which I\u2019m sure you can imagine doesn\u2019t always make me very popular.",
        "On infrastructure, I\u2019m pressing departments to make sure they deliver their plans on schedule.",
        "And we need to do more. More to help support jobs and growth in our communities.",
        "Because growth can\u2019t be imposed from the centre \u2013 it must be driven by businesses, communities and local authorities.",
        "They are critical to delivering the jobs and homes that our communities need.",
        "So I\u2019d like to tell you about the next steps in our Plan for Growth.",
        "To support local growth, I can today announce my decision to reduce the interest rate offered to local authorities by the Public Works Loan Board to finance the \u00a313bn of debt needed to leave the Housing Revenue Account subsidy system.",
        "I\u2019ve listened to local authority concerns that this is a one-off transaction within the public sector and should be financed as such.",
        "Let me put it simply \u2013 an extra \u00a3100m every year that councils can then reinvest in housing.",
        "And I want to take a further step to support local growth.",
        "Across the country, projects are being held back by tough market conditions, difficult cash flow and a lack of confidence. Projects where people could be working but aren\u2019t.",
        "That is why I\u2019m announcing today the creation of a new Growing Places Fund.",
        "Half a billion pounds that will kick start developments that are currently stalled.",
        "Half a billion pounds that will deliver key infrastructure and create jobs.",
        "Putting local areas in the driving seat, to boost the local economy and get people into work.",
        "Providing flexibility to local areas to recycle funding for other projects once development is completed.",
        "In South Gloucestershire, \u00a3300 million of private investment, 3,000 jobs and 2,200 homes is being unlocked with \u00a36 million of public money to build a link road. Just think what we will be able to do with \u00a3500 million.",
        "Unlocking local growth by freeing businesses to grow, creating jobs, and freeing councils to build housing. Liberal Democrats in government, on your side.",
        "We\u2019re on your side when it comes to the banks too.",
        "Delivering on our promise to protect the taxpayer from the cost of future bailouts. Never again should bankers go to the casino with their stakes guaranteed by the rest of us.",
        "That\u2019s why we commissioned the Vickers report",
        "It\u2019s why we welcomed his recommendations on ring-fencing.",
        "It\u2019s why we welcomed his call to extend competition in the banking sector.",
        "And it\u2019s why we will legislate to protect future taxpayers in this Parliament.",
        "Of course, our main tool to help low and middle income families with the pressures they are facing is the tax system.",
        "Thanks to Liberal Democrats there is genuine progress.",
        "And I\u2019m not just talking about fuel duty cuts for our remotest communities, though I expect we will have that in place next year.",
        "This year, the average worker is paying \u00a3200 less income tax than last year. Next year, the bill will come down by another \u00a3120. By the end of this Parliament, most working people will be paying \u00a3700 less income tax a year.",
        "Conference, an income tax threshold of \u00a310,000 was the first priority in our manifesto. Now it\u2019s the first tax priority of the government. We should be proud that in government our ideas are making a real difference to every working family in Britain.",
        "But we shouldn\u2019t rest on our laurels. In the next Parliament, I want us to go further; our aspiration should be that someone working full time on the minimum wage should pay no income tax at all.",
        "An income tax threshold of \u00a312,500 \u2013 think what that would do to work incentives, think what it would mean for basic fairness.",
        "Let\u2019s put that on the front page of our next manifesto.",
        "Some people have argued that we should change our tax priorities and focus our limited resources on cutting taxes for the wealthiest instead.",
        "At a time of austerity, this argument simply beggars belief. If we are all in this together, those with the broadest shoulders must bear the greatest burden.",
        "Fair taxation of the wealthiest is key to our deficit reduction plan. Of course, if a better way can be found to raise the money from this group, I will be willing to consider it.",
        "But right now we must focus relentlessly on those who are struggling.",
        "And we need to make sure tax owed is tax paid.",
        "Last year, I announced a package of investment to strengthen our fight against tax evasion, as well as tax avoidance.",
        "Let me tell you how we\u2019re getting on.",
        "This year, an additional 2,250 HMRC staff will move into new anti-evasion and avoidance jobs.",
        "This month, over 1,000 of these jobs are being advertised.",
        "And already this package is bearing fruit.",
        "I promised you we\u2019d collect an extra \u00a37bn a year by the end of the Parliament;",
        "And I can tell you we\u2019re already on track to raise \u00a32bn this year.",
        "It took 12 years for the previous Government to take action against the wealthiest 5,000 people some of who weren\u2019t paying their fair share of tax.",
        "We can do better than that.",
        "In less than a month\u2019s time, a new \u2018affluent team\u2019 will be place. This team will look specifically at the next 350,000 wealthiest taxpayers.",
        "These are the people who pay or should pay the 50p rate of tax. And my message to the small minority who don\u2019t pay what they owe is simple, I agree with the Chancellor. \u201cWe will find you and your money\u201d and you will pay your fair share.",
        "Economic credibility comes from doing the right thing \u2013 that\u2019s why Labour lost it.",
        "At the next election, we can make sure there will be only one party that people trust to both handle the economy and deliver fairness \u2013 the Liberal Democrats.",
        "We\u2019ll win that trust by sticking to our guns, especially when times are tough.",
        "We\u2019ll do that by levelling with people about the scale of the challenge we face, not offering false promises as Labour did.",
        "By delivering our aspiration to rebuild a more sustainable and balanced economy.",
        "By showing that we understand the fears and the pressures on the people of this country, and share their ambition for a better Britain.",
        "Most of all, we will do that by building a shared sense of national economic purpose so that we are working alongside every person in this country to restore our prosperity.",
        "Do you remember how Gordon Brown liked to conclude his speeches?",
        "Long lists \u2013 did you find them annoying? I know I used to.",
        "But not now, with so many Lib Dem achievements already in place, I can\u2019t resist:",
        "A clear plan to deal with the deficit, removing barriers to business growth, investing in infrastructure, promoting free trade and competition, sorting out the banks,",
        "tackling tax avoidance, and cutting taxes for those who need it most.",
        "That is the economic policy of the Liberal Democrats in government and it is a record to be proud of."
