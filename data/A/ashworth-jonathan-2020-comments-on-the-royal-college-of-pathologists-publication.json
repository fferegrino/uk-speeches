        "This virus hasn\u2019t gone away, it could easily get out of control again. Without a strategy to test, trace and isolate people, society will not be able to reopen safely. Labour has called for testing to be expanded further beyond symptomatic carriers and joined up with a comprehensive tracing operation, which should be locally-led and properly integrated with primary care. Both are crucial in the fight against this virus, and every day without proper action puts too many people at risk."
