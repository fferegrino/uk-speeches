        "Boris Johnson has finally admitted the Government has mishandled its response to the Coronavirus. It was too slow to acknowledge the threat of the virus, too slow to enter lockdown and too slow to take this crisis seriously.",
        "The threat of a second wave is still very real. It is imperative the Government learns the lessons of its mistakes so we can help to save lives."
