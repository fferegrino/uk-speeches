    "content": [
        "In a sleight of hand Sajid Javid is refusing to back up the \u00a32.2 billion pay settlement with the cash needed, instead expecting overstretched hospitals to find this extra money.",
        "The NHS is in a summer crisis with rising Covid admissions, cancer operations cancelled, emergency demand intensifying and ambulance trusts under pressure.",
        "The NHS needs a fully funded plan to provide quality care, and bring ballooning waiting lists down. Alongside this, Ministers must provide the NHS with the extra investment required to give staff a pay rise."
