    "content": [
        "I don\u2019t know where Labour are standing with their all-women short-list, I thought they\u2019d scrapped it as they have got I think 51% of their MPs now in Parliament are females. Now, if Eddie Izzard gets elected, I don\u2019t know whether that increases or decreases the percentage because I\u2019m not sure what he\u2019s all about, Keir Starmer\u2019s not sure what he\u2019s all about.",
        "You know what, the old traditional working-class Labour voters will take a look at Eddie Izzard and think, you know, really, is that what\u2019s coming to Parliament? I think it opens a whole new debate, mate. I\u2019m going to be honest now, controversial as always, if he does get elected and I\u2019m still here, I shouldn\u2019t be following him into the toilets."
