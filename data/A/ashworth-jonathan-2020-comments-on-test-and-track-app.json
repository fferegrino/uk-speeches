    "content": [
        "This is unsurprising and yet another example of where the government\u2019s response has been slow and badly managed. It\u2019s meant precious time and money wasted.",
        "For months tech experts warned ministers about the flaws in their app which is why we wrote to Matt Hancock encouraging the government to consider digital alternatives back in May.",
        "Ministers must now urgently prioritise building a fully effective test, trace and isolate regime lead by local expertise to break the chains of transmission of this deadly virus."
