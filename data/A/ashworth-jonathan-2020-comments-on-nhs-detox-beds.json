    "summary": "The comments made by Jonathan Ashworth, the Shadow Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, on 19 August 2020.",
    "content": [
        "I\u2019ve long warned that after years of public health cuts we are facing an addiction crisis, and closing our remaining detox beds will mean more people lose their lives to alcohol abuse and drug misuse.",
        "It\u2019s especially concerning that these warnings come as the Secretary of State embarks on a risky and irresponsible dismantling of Public Health England, with no idea who will lead on addiction nationally.",
        "As covid-19 has cruelly reminded us, improving population health is integral to health security and that must mean properly investing in public health services, not cutting them."
