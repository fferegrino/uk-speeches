    "content": [
        "There are hundreds of millions of pounds locked in a Stormont bank account that can help ease the pressures people are facing, but it cannot be spent because of the DUP\u2019s cruel block on an Executive being formed.",
        "The DUP\u2019s refusal to form a government has also created uncertainty on the roll out of the \u00a3400 payment to support every household in the north.",
        "So rather than looking for others to blame for their failures, the economy minister should tell his party to stop punishing ordinary workers and families and form a government now. That is the easiest way to get money into pockets.",
        "As we face an increasingly bleak winter, people rightly want ministers around the table and working together to help workers, families and businesses who are struggling to pay their bills and keep their shutters up.",
        "Sinn F\u00e9in is ready to form an Executive today, to work with others, and put money in people\u2019s pockets to tackle the cost-of-living emergency. That\u2019s our focus."
