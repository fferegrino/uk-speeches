        "As a founding member of the UN Human Rights Council, the UK has been a strong advocate of its vital work since its inception, and we are honoured to be elected for a fifth term.",
        "We will keep using our voice to help strengthen the Council, and to support countries working to improve their human rights record. We will continue to hold to account all those responsible for the worst violations and abuses.",
        "The UK strives to be a force for for good in the world, working to protect the most vulnerable from some of the most pressing global human rights issues. This includes making sure girls\u2019 have access to a quality education, working to end violence against women and girls, standing up for democratic values and media freedom, and protecting freedom of religion or belief.",
        "I thank those who supported our candidacy and look forward to working closely with the members of the Council, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and civil society to deliver our election pledges."
