        "These figures show the alarming and sustained pressure the NHS has been under for months now \u2013 impacting all areas of treatment. Hospitals are struggling to deliver urgent care in the most difficult of circumstances, while over 190,000 people have now been waiting over a year for treatment.",
        "Years of underfunding, bed cuts and understaffing left our NHS exposed when the Coronavirus epidemic hit us. It is vital that we now have a Herculean effort to roll out at least two million vaccines a week, with NHS staff vaccinations completed in the next week, to ease pressure on our NHS."
