    "content": [
        "The Government are so desperate for a positive headline that they are now recycling money previously announced. This is not new funding. It\u2019s a rehash of funding announced last year which is too little, too late.",
        "With Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services referrals doubling and children going back to school in a matter of days, these resources were needed much sooner.",
        "This is simply a small sticking plaster during a mental health crisis."
