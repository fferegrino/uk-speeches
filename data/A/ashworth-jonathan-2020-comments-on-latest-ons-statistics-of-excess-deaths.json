    "content": [
        "The official confirmation today that England has had the highest level of excess deaths in Europe is a devastating moment.",
        "Every life lost is a tragedy and leaves behind grieving families. We can no longer hide from the fact the Government has not handled this crisis well and needs to urgently learn lessons from its mistakes.",
        "Boris Johnson must now take responsibility for why we were so badly prepared. As we start to see a resurgence in other parts of the world, ministers need to urgently outline the steps they are taking to better protect people and save lives in the months ahead."
