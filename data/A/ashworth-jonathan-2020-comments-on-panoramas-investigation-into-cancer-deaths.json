        "These figures should be wake up call for Ministers \u2013 we already know that there\u2019s been a drop in urgent referrals for cancer and waiting times for vital scans are soaring.",
        "There will be tragic consequences if Ministers do not urgently put in place the measures needed to restore cancer services and get people the treatment they need.",
        "We need a fully-resourced plan to restart cancer services; a strategy that enables us to move between the competing demands of the Covid-19 pandemic and non-Covid related care in the months ahead."
