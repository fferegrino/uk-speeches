        "**Lee Anderson (Ashfield) (Con)**",
        "Now then. In 2014, the shadow Health Secretary said that he would support strikes within the NHS, even if there was a Labour Government in power, but he is remarkably quiet today about whether he actually supports the strikes\u2014unlike the RMT strikes, which I am sure that he supports. Does the Minister think that the shadow Health Secretary and Opposition Front Benchers are playing politics with this issue?",
        "**Will Quince**",
        "I am not one to cast aspersions on the shadow Secretary of State, other than to say that I and the Secretary of State refuse to play politics with this issue. This is all about patient safety and ensuring that if industrial action goes ahead\u2014[Interruption.] The shadow Secretary of State again shouts \u201cNegotiate\u201d from a sedentary position, but he knows that we have an independent pay review body, process and mechanism. It is important that we respect that."
