    "content": [
        "It is an honour and a challenge to become chair of the European Movement at this time of crisis in Britain\u2019s relations with Europe. Churchill founded the European Movement to bring Britain and continental Europe closer together \u2013 socially, economically and politically \u2013 after the horrors of the Second World War and the Holocaust. We have a duty to seek to do the same again after the experience of COVID19 and Brexit, faced with the twin emergencies of climate change and a global slump.",
        "We will campaign strongly to put right the immediate failings of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, including the lack of automatic EU work visas for artists, musicians, engineers and architects; the absence of EU market access for our huge financial and business services industries; and the end of our membership of the Erasmus scheme for student exchanges. Millions are affected and we need to change these damaging policies as soon as possible, which almost no one voted for as part of Brexit."
