    "content": [
        "Thank you for the introduction, Jessica.",
        "It\u2019s a pleasure to be here. I think you may have been expecting someone else a couple of weeks ago, but I am absolutely thrilled to have taken on the Civil Society portfolio and to be here today.",
        "Thank you Carol and Jessica for inviting me. I know this is a big event in the ACF calendar, as well as being your first \u2018in person\u2019 conference in the last three years.",
        "It is also my first engagement as Minister for Civil Society, and I am delighted to be in the presence of so many inspiring leaders of such a vital part of our sector.",
        "Trusts and foundations are lifelines to so many civil society organisations \u2013 providing crucial independent funding to enable them to carry out their work and support communities across the country.",
        "I\u2019d like to extend my thanks and appreciation to you, the leaders of trusts and foundations, for the resilience you\u2019ve shown over the past few challenging years. And the determination you\u2019ve displayed in tackling our current economic challenges.",
        "Your wealth of experience is a clear asset to be harnessed in promoting innovation in philanthropy, empowering the sector, and supporting trusts and foundations to thrive.",
        "As you might know, my early career was in the charitable sector. As a fundraiser, I understood the generosity of the British public as well as the importance of philanthropy.",
        "At Hope House Children\u2019s Hospice, I experienced first hand the challenges that crises can have on giving \u2013 I was there at a time where donations dropped 50% during the Kosovo crisis.",
        "We had to come up with solutions at a fast pace. And I\u2019m aware of how \u2013 amidst the current pressures \u2013 funders have had to quickly adapt to a changing environment.",
        "Throughout my career \u2013 in charities, and in politics \u2013 I have witnessed the impact that valuable funds can have for those who need it most \u2013 from vital health services for children and their families, to tackling homelessness, and levelling up our communities.",
        "I know you have been focussing today on courageous leadership, and what it means over the next 10 years.",
        "To me, courageous leadership is about three things: resilience, collaboration and humility.",
        "We are facing unprecedented times \u2013 the global pandemic, climate change, Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine, and the cost of living have created significant impacts across our society.",
        "And it is the civil society organisations who are on the front line \u2013 helping individuals and families.",
        "We have seen the resilience of great leaders and trustees who are able to adapt, pivot and flex against these challenges.",
        "I\u2019ve been inspired by the work and innovation in the civil society sector to make precious resources go further to reach those most in need.",
        "I also believe that resilience means drawing on support.",
        "I\u2019m aware that trusts and foundations are seeing increased demand, and organisations \u2013 from small to large \u2013 are facing higher energy prices.",
        "And I know that many of you are looking at the grants you have in place with vital civil society organisations \u2013 and are now providing flexibility, or additional funding to help them through the challenges they are facing.",
        "In Government, we are also taking action to support these organisations by helping them with their bills over the winter, as part of our Energy Bill Relief Scheme.",
        "And my department will continue to engage constructively across the civil society sector to monitor the impact of rising costs and pressures.",
        "In order to be resilient, to be truly resilient in a way that allows us to \u2018spring back\u2019, we also need strong foundations to ensure our impact is sustainable.",
        "ACF\u2019s Stronger Foundations initiative does just that \u2013 bringing foundations together to share best practice \u2013 from strategy to investment \u2013 with the aim of understanding and promoting what works best.",
        "At a time of huge global change, collaboration is more important than ever.",
        "I was impressed to see that your Stronger Foundations format is a world leader, with influence outside the UK.",
        "And finally, courageous leadership is about humility. As leaders, we don\u2019t know it all, and never will. Acknowledging that is courageous.",
        "We must continually listen to those around us \u2013 to those whose views resonate with ours \u2013 and just as importantly \u2013 those which challenge them.",
        "As Minister for Sport, Tourism and Civil Society, including Minister for Equalities, there are \u2013 quite literally \u2013 countless opportunities to connect across my portfolio and the intersections of this amazing sector.",
        "I am committed to listening to your views, championing the fantastic achievements of civil society, and building a strong relationship together.",
        "Thank you again for inviting me here today. I look forward to meeting with some of you this evening, and to working with you in the months and years ahead."
