        "Derelict sites are often found in more disadvantaged areas and can hold back development of communities.",
        "This programme is delivering community regeneration and tackling climate change, in line with our national strategy to transform the economy and deliver sustainable and inclusive growth and a fairer society.",
        "At the same time as announcing these grants, we are opening the programme to projects seeking funding in 2023/24 and I look forward to building on the momentum generated by today\u2019s investments."
