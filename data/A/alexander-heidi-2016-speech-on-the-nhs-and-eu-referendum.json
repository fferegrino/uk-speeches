    "summary": "Below is the text of the speech made by Heidi Alexander, the Shadow Secretary of State for Health, on 8 June 2016.",
    "content": [
        "Thank you, Wendy \u2013 and thank you to UNISON for hosting us today.",
        "In fifteen days\u2019 time the British people will take the biggest political decision of my lifetime \u2013 whether or not we should remain part of the European Union.",
        "I was just two months old when the last referendum on Europe took place.",
        "Back then, the questions my parents\u2019 generation had to answer were similar to the questions we face today:",
        "What is in the best interest of me and my family?",
        "How can we guarantee our country\u2019s security and influence in a changing world?",
        "And how do we ensure a strong economy that delivers decent jobs and decent public services?",
        "In 1975, my parents voted to stay in the Common Market and like millions of others, I have grown up taking our membership of the EU for granted.",
        "Easy travel, the opportunity to study and work abroad, the basic principle that we would co-operate with the countries closest to us to foster progress and tackle shared challenges.",
        "I don\u2019t claim the EU is perfect. It is in need of reform. But I have no doubt that overall our interests are best served by staying in.",
        "Whether it\u2019s the economy, jobs, trade or our ability to deal with the big global issues which don\u2019t respect national borders, we are better off working with our European neighbours than going it alone.",
        "Now, the past few weeks of this campaign have sometimes felt like a beauty contest for the next leader of the Conservative Party.",
        "I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m fed up of it.",
        "Fed up of the mud-slinging and the name-calling.",
        "Fed up of the dry debates about sovereignty and the rebate.",
        "And fed up of being told that people like me, a comprehensive girl from Swindon are somehow part of an elitist establishment that have been brainwashed by bureaucrats from Brussels.",
        "Boris, Nigel \u2013 I can assure you that is NOT the case.",
        "It seems to me the public want less spin and more substance in this debate. They want to understand what their vote on the 23rd June means for them and for the things they care about \u2013 like the National Health Service.",
        "And that\u2019s what I want to talk to you about today",
        "I have been the shadow health secretary for nine months now.",
        "And in that time I have seen the critical state that the NHS is in.",
        "Hospital finances are spiralling out of control.",
        "Mental health patients are bussed half way across the country for a bed.",
        "Waiting lists are up.",
        "Staff morale is down.",
        "And the care sector is on the brink of collapse.",
        "Don\u2019t let anyone tell you this is the fault of migrants \u2013 this is the fault of Ministers.",
        "I am under no illusion about the scale of the challenge facing the NHS and the risks associated with another four years of Tory Government.",
        "However, I am absolutely clear that leaving the EU would make the challenges greater and the risks bigger for an already fragile NHS.",
        "I could talk to you this morning about the billions of pounds we receive from European research grants.",
        "How EU laws on air pollution and food packaging are helping to improve our nation\u2019s health.",
        "Or the protection we receive when we travel to the continent through the European Health Insurance Card.",
        "These are all important issues. But I want to focus my remarks this morning on the threat of Brexit to people who work in the NHS and to people who rely on the NHS.",
        "We\u2019re here at UNISON this morning because this is a union that stands up for its members \u2013 the nurses, health care assistants, midwives, health visitors, paramedics, technicians and many, many more who keep our health service running.",
        "UNISON stands up for jobs; for our standard of living; and for the public services upon which we all rely.",
        "You understand the importance of our membership to the EU.",
        "And that is why your members have overwhelmingly backed the case for us to remain.",
        "Now, I know that being a frontline member of staff in the NHS at the moment is hard going.",
        "I know how you constantly feel as if you are being asked to do more for less.",
        "How cuts to nurse training places mean staff are overworked and spread too thin.",
        "And how you are left picking up the pieces of a social care system which is on its knees due to years of underfunding.",
        "I know that if we want our NHS to be there in the years and decades to come, we must invest in the current generation of staff and the next generation too.",
        "We shouldn\u2019t be scrapping student nurse bursaries, putting off the next generation of midwives and healthcare worker.",
        "No, we want more home-grown NHS staff and we should put our money where our mouth is.",
        "But we have to be honest: as of today, parts of the health system would not function without the contribution of EU migrants.",
        "Put simply, you\u2019re more likely to come across a migrant caring for you in a hospital, then in the bed next to you.",
        "52,000 people working in the NHS today are from other European countries.",
        "These are doctors, nurses and midwives who work day-in, day-out saving lives and caring for our loved ones through ill health.",
        "Two years ago my grandmother passed away. Who was it that sat by her bedside and dabbed water onto her dry lips in the days before she died?",
        "It was a polish care assistant called Kristina.",
        "Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I want young people to grow up in this country, wanting those jobs. I want those positions to be paid at decent wages and for people to see care as a vocation and not as a job of last resort.",
        "But at the moment, our care system relies upon people like Kristina.",
        "The job she did helped my gran to have the dignity and support I wanted for her at the end of her life.",
        "If we vote to leave, what would happen to Kristina and the thousands of other staff like her?",
        "What restrictions would there be on recruiting new staff?",
        "Would existing staff have to leave if they didn\u2019t earn enough to meet income thresholds to renew visas?",
        "Would hospitals be able to fill staff shortages without immediate access to the pool of qualified staff from other European countries?",
        "The truth is we just don\u2019t know.",
        "And it\u2019s not just these questions no-one can answer.",
        "In fact every time leave campaigners are asked what Britain would look like if we left the EU their answer is always the same \u2013 we just don\u2019t know.",
        "So at a time when hospital wards are already dangerously understaffed, when the care system is already in crisis, is leaving the EU a risk the NHS can afford to take?",
        "I don\u2019t think so \u2013 and I don\u2019t think many patients would agree either.",
        "And that brings me onto the threat of Brexit to patient care.",
        "The financial crisis facing the NHS today is the worst in its history.",
        "Hospitals ended the last year more than \u00a32.4 billion in the red.",
        "Extra money allocated to this year has gone towards paying off the bills from last year.",
        "It has got so bad that the Health Secretary can\u2019t even guarantee his Department has kept within its own spending limits.",
        "I am in no doubt that as a country we need to have a big, open and honest debate about the future funding of health and care in England.",
        "A big debate about how we pay for elderly care and how we reshape our services to meet the needs of our ageing population.",
        "That\u2019s a process I want to lead as Labour\u2019s Shadow Health Secretary.",
        "But I know too that the economic shock of a vote to leave Europe risks plunging the health service into an even deeper financial crisis.",
        "The Institute for Fiscal Studies warned last month that if we leave the European Union, Britain could face another two years of austerity.",
        "The economy would slow.",
        "Tax income would fall.",
        "And public sector spending would be squeezed even further.",
        "In the worst-case scenario, new analysis published by Labour today reveals that the Tories would have to cut the Department of Health\u2019s budget by up to \u00a310.5 billion in 2019/20 to meet their promise of balancing the books by the end of the Parliament.",
        "That\u2019s \u00a310.5 billion pounds worth of cuts which if made today would mean every hospital trust in England cutting 1,000 nurses and 155 doctors.",
        "It\u2019s the equivalent of the entire annual budget for the NHS in London.",
        "These are future cuts that the NHS could well do without.",
        "Now I think I know what the leave camp is going to say \u2013 I\u2019ve read the leaflets, I\u2019ve watched the adverts, I\u2019ve seen the bus.",
        "They claim if we leave the EU then we\u2019ll have a load of extra money to throw around.",
        "Well let me be absolutely clear \u2013 this claim is misleading, simplistic and complete and utter nonsense.",
        "They began this campaign promising \u00a3350 million a week more to the NHS. Now it\u2019s \u00a3100 million. At this rate, by the 23 June it\u2019s probably going to be zero.",
        "Because how many times have the Brexit brigade spent this money? First they said it could build hospitals, and then schools, and then they could use it to cut VAT and the cut council tax and then fix potholes.",
        "Come on, really?",
        "What answer do they have to economists who are lining up to say in the short term an economic downturn is almost inevitable? And what does that mean for NHS finances?",
        "And who are these people making these claims? Most of them are just pretenders to David Cameron\u2019s throne. These aren\u2019t manifesto commitments, they are the cheap lines of people prepared to say anything to get your vote.",
        "Just because the bus has got the NHS logo plastered on its side, doesn\u2019t mean for a second that you should trust the people sat in its seats.",
        "People like Boris Johnson who has written that \u201cpeople [should] have to pay\u201d for the NHS.",
        "People like Daniel Hannan and Douglas Carswell who have called for a \u201cprice-mechanism in healthcare\u201d.",
        "Or people like Nigel Farage, who was caught on video, saying that he wants the NHS to move to an insurance based system like the United States.",
        "When Leave campaigners say it\u2019s time for ordinary people to take back control, what they really mean is it\u2019s time for people like them to take control.",
        "Iain Duncan Smith, Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage taking control of our NHS.",
        "I couldn\u2019t think of anything worse.",
        "But don\u2019t take my word for it.",
        "This is what John Major had to say on Sunday:",
        "\u201cThe NHS is about as safe with them as a pet hamster would be with a hungry python.\u201d",
        "Now I don\u2019t often agree with John Major, but when Tories say they don\u2019t trust the Tories with the NHS, I think it\u2019s probably worth listening.",
        "I want to finish by returning to why this referendum is important to me and to my family.",
        "Eighty years ago my grandfather and my husband\u2019s Austrian grandfather found themselves on opposing sides in the Second World War.",
        "Now, some say the role of the EU in keeping the peace since then has been overstated.",
        "I\u2019m not so sure.",
        "An organisation which routinely brings together leaders, governments and policy makers across a continent seems like a pretty sensible idea to me.",
        "We might not always get our way, but in the grown up world of international politics, we have to be sat at the table and not out in the cold.",
        "Peace in Europe is taken for granted by my generation.",
        "But when parties such as Golden Dawn rear their head in Greece and when barbed wire fencing goes up in Hungary, Macedonia and Bulgaria to keep foreigners out, we shouldn\u2019t be turning our back on our neighbours, we should be helping them to find solutions.",
        "Ugly nationalism and ignorant prejudice have no place in British politics. We have fought it before \u2013 a few weeks ago in the case of London \u2013 and we will fight it again. We must not allow this referendum campaign to give some sort of perverse permission for it.",
        "This month\u2019s vote isn\u2019t just about our membership of the EU. It\u2019s about the type of country we want to be and the message we want to send to the rest of the world.",
        "So in two weeks\u2019 time let\u2019s send that message loud and clear.",
        "That Britain is better off in Europe.",
        "That Britain is stronger and safer in Europe.",
        "And that Britain shares that intrinsic Labour value that by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone.",
        "This is the campaign of our generation \u2013 let\u2019s go out there and win it.",
        "Thank you very much."
