    "summary": "The comments made by Douglas Alexander, the then Shadow Foreign Secretary, on 22 April 2015.",
    "content": [
        "Foreign Office Ministers spent months arguing against search and rescue missions, opposed them at an EU level and didn\u2019t even reference them in recent public statements as recently as this weekend.",
        "Yet today, under pressure in the BBC\u2019s Daily Politics Election Debate on Foreign Affairs, Philip Hammond admitted that search and rescue must form part of any EU response to this crisis in the Mediterranean.",
        "Now it\u2019s time to turn Philip Hammond\u2019s words into practical European action. So when he goes to Brussels this week, David Cameron carries a heavy responsibility to ensure an urgent reassessment of the current EU patrol mission to prevent further loss of life.",
        "Six months ago it was his own Minister, Baroness Anelay, who said that search and rescue in the Mediterranean created \u201cunintended pull factors\u201d, but today the Foreign Secretary has been forced to admit the government were just wrong."
