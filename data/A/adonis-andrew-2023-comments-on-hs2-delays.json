        "A big mistake to delay HS2 north of Birmingham. It will add to costs and delay benefits. Also puts Manchester at huge competitive disadvantage to Birmingham for a decade or more. Birmingham will be barely half an hour from London by HS2, while Manchester will be more than 2 hours.",
        "Birmingham will also have an HS2 connection directly into Elizabeth Line at Old Oak Common, whereas Manchester won\u2019t (at Euston) which means onward journeys to West End, City and Canary Wharf will be far slower and more congested from Manchester."
