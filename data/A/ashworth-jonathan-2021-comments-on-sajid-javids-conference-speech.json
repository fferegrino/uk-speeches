    "content": [
        "This was an empty speech that will hugely disappoint the many thousands of patients who are anxious and scared, those waiting longer for cancer treatment or surgery, those waiting for a doctor\u2019s appointment and those increasingly forced to pay for surgery.",
        "Tory MPs have imposed a punishing, unfair tax rise on working people yet Ministers have no plan to rebuild and reform health care to bring waiting times down and deliver the quality care people deserve."
