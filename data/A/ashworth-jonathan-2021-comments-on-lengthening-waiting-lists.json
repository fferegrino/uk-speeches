    "content": [
        "Years of underfunding and cutbacks meant we entered the crisis with waiting lists growing and targets for cancer treatment missed.",
        "But there shouldn\u2019t have to be a choice between Covid care and cancer care.",
        "It is now crucial that ministers provide hospitals, our NHS staff and patients with a fully resourced rescue plan to bring waiting lists down.",
        "That starts with giving our NHS staff a fair pay rise and recruiting the extra doctors and nurses we need for the future. And we need the very best cutting edge technology and equipment to deliver the standards of care people deserve.",
        "Leaving patients in limbo waiting for surgery risks their condition worsening leading to permanent disability, loss of livelihood and tragically for some loss of life.",
        "Labour will be using our voice and vote in parliament to demand action to bring waiting lists down and deliver the very best cancer and mental health care."
