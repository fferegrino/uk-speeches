        "Street names are often a proud part of a community\u2019s identity and hold cherished memories for those that have lived there past and present.",
        "As part of our mission to level up across the country, we want communities to take back control so we are putting the power over street names changes into the hands of local people who would be most directly affected.",
        "Our new laws will stop councils pushing through street names changes that communities don\u2019t want."
