    "content": [
        "This report provides yet more evidence of what residents up and down the country already know \u2013 there is a whole system failure on building regulation and the Government progress has been painfully slow.",
        "Ministers have repeatedly missed targets to remove cladding, failed to release adequate funding, and done little to help leaseholders stuck in dangerous buildings facing ever increasing bills.",
        "The Government must take responsibility for this crisis and act urgently to ensure a tragedy such as Grenfell is not repeated."
