        "Labour welcomes this enforcement action by the CMA and called for robust measures to be taken against scandalous practices from irresponsible property developers.",
        "This is a significant milestone in the campaign for leasehold justice but given this incompetent Government\u2019s total inaction to reform leasehold, too many people remain trapped in this feudal system.",
        "This Government can no longer drag its heels: it must act now and legislate to end this broken system once and for all."
