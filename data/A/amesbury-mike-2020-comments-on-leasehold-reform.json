    "content": [
        "This report is another reminder of the Government\u2019s failure to reform the long-running scandal of leasehold.",
        "Despite numerous Government press releases and other announcements over the years, there is still no sign of real change for 4.5 million homebuyers locked into unfair feudal leasehold contracts that should have been consigned to the history books long ago.",
        "Homebuyers don\u2019t need another consultation, they need action: the Government needs to come forward with legislation and finally end this medieval injustice."
