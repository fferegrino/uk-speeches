        "Boris Johnson\u2019s failure to confront Dominic Cummings over his lockdown breach was a monumental misjudgment.",
        "The government rightly asked the British people to make huge sacrifices to drive down infection rates. So to have allowed his most senior advisor to blatantly break the rules undermined vital life saving public health messaging at the peak of this deadly pandemic."
