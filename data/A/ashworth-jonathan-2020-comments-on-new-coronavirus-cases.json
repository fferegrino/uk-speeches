        "Today\u2019s increase in Coronavirus cases is deeply concerning and a stark reminder that there is no room for complacency in tackling the spread of the virus.",
        "This increase, combined with the ongoing testing fiasco where ill people are told to drive for miles for tests, and the poor performance of the contact tracing system, needs an explanation from Ministers.",
        "Matt Hancock must come to the House of Commons tomorrow to set out what is being done to get testing back on track and bring case numbers down."
