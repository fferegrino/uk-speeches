        "Labour has been calling for regular testing of NHS staff for months \u2013 it must now be an urgent priority. Weekly testing of all frontline healthcare workers reduces the spread of the virus and helps protect NHS staff and patients.",
        "It is important that the NHS can treat Covid and non-Covid patients at the same time. This should include putting in place infection control measures to make sure patients can continue to safely receive their care, and routine testing of all staff should be a part of this."
