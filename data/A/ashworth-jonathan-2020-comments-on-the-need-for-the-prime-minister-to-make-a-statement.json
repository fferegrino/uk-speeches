        "It has been apparent for some days that the virus is again out of control in parts of the country. The Government\u2019s tiered system has failed to stem its spread.",
        "This is an incredibly serious moment and people are worried. The Prime Minister has refused to take action to limit the virus\u2019 spread over Christmas. All he has offered so far is confusion and indecision.",
        "He must now address the nation to explain what action he will be taking."
