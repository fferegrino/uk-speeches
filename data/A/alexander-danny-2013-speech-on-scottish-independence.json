        "I\u2019m very glad to be here with you this evening.",
        "I must also say, I\u2019m glad to have an excuse not to be in the Houses of Parliament on bonfire night.",
        "It\u2019s been 408 years, but you can\u2019t take any chances!",
        "Perhaps there aren\u2019t yet fireworks in the UK economy, but we\u2019re on the way back.",
        "Not fully recovered, but we are seeing signs of recovery.",
        "It has been a long, hard road.",
        "And there\u2019s a long way to go.",
        "But \u2013 thanks to the hard work of businesses, the length and breadth of the UK \u2013 we are starting to see signs of a recovery.",
        "Scotland is playing a key role in helping the UK economy to turn the corner.",
        "Scottish business proving \u2013 once again \u2013 that Scotland is highly successful within the UK.",
        "In 2012 Scotland had a higher economic output per head than Denmark, Finland and Portugal\u2026",
        "A higher employment rate than Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg\u2026",
        "And Edinburgh is one of the cities really leading the way\u2026",
        "With output per head at 165% the UK average.",
        "Those successful cities and companies\u2026",
        "Really benefit from being part of a strongly integrated UK.",
        "Where nearly two thirds of Scottish exports go to the rest of the UK.",
        "And in capital\u2026",
        "With 84% of mortgages\u2026",
        "91% of pensions\u2026",
        "And 89% of ISAs\u2026",
        "Provided by Scottish firms to non-Scottish customers.",
        "And \u2013 in return \u2013 70% of Scottish pension holders\u2026",
        "And over half our mortgage owners\u2026",
        "Having bought products outside Scotland.",
        "Those cities and those companies and those industries performing well\u2026",
        "Have been able to help our economy because of decisions taken by the UK government\u2026",
        "Our efforts to build a more competitive and fair tax system.",
        "To tackle regulation.",
        "To reform the planning system.",
        "Obviously not in Scotland \u2013 that\u2019s a matter for the Scottish Government.",
        "To invest in our skills and infrastructure\u2026",
        "And \u2013 of course \u2013 every accountant will know the importance of balancing the books\u2026",
        "And the very tough decisions we\u2019ve had to take to reduce Government spending\u2026",
        "And to deal with the deficit\u2026",
        "Have maintained the international credibility of the UK\u2026",
        "And shown that as a country we can pay our way in the world.",
        "We\u2019ve all worked so hard to create this recovery\u2026",
        "We must now work equally hard, to avoid putting it at risk.",
        "And an obvious \u2013 and increasingly imminent \u2013 threat to our collective prosperity is the referendum on Scottish independence.",
        "Those who propose independence would have us \u2013 Scotland \u2013 separate from the UK.",
        "So after we\u2019ve demonstrated the importance of strong UK-wide support to our financial sector\u2026",
        "\u2026after we\u2019ve seen the benefits and resilience of the strength of our currency, the UK pound\u2026",
        "\u2026and just as we\u2019re starting to witness a recovery that the government wants to see shared through the whole UK\u2026",
        "\u2026we would walk away.",
        "We have to make sure that the people of Scotland have access to all the information they need\u2026",
        "To make the right decision next September.",
        "I want to pay tribute to ICAS, for their influential role in this debate\u2026",
        "And I\u2019d like to thank you for engaging in the discussion\u2026",
        "Especially with your pensions paper\u2026",
        "Which provided a very important angle on a very important issue\u2026",
        "And really changed the terms of the debate.",
        "As I\u2019m sure many of you in this room will know\u2026",
        "The UK government have been publishing papers to inform the debate \u2013 like yours \u2013 throughout the year\u2026",
        "And our papers too, have highlighted some of the challenges and risks that independence would present, on issues like\u2026",
        "Security\u2026",
        "And defence\u2026",
        "And the success of the financial sector north of the border.",
        "We\u2019ve got further papers coming up.",
        "But the issue I\u2019d like to return to briefly this evening\u2026",
        "Is our study of the currency options in an independent Scotland.",
        "Just to warn you the last time I spoke in public about this paper was a 40 minute lecture at the University of Stirling!",
        "But I\u2019ll try to be slightly more succinct here!",
        "It\u2019s not clear to me that a currency union would be in the interest of Scotland or the UK.",
        "I look at this issue from 2 perspectives.",
        "The first is as a passionate Scot who wants the best for the people of Scotland.",
        "But I also look at this in a hard headed way as a Cabinet Minister in the UK\u2019s economic and finance Ministry.",
        "The lessons learned from the Eurozone have been clear.",
        "That while such arrangements can appear successful in a period of stability and growth\u2026",
        "They can lead to brutal readjustments in times of economic stress and uncertainty.",
        "No one should think that because we see the signs of recovery\u2026",
        "That we\u2019ll forget the lessons of the crisis.",
        "No one should assume that a strengthening UK economy increases the likelihood of a currency union between an independent Scotland and the continuing UK.",
        "It doesn\u2019t because the fundamental problems remain.",
        "An independent Scotland would be very different to Scotland as it is today \u2013 fully integrated into the UK economy.",
        "Just consider the disproportionate impact that a collapse in oil prices would have.",
        "If markets sensed that monetary policy \u2013 set by the Bank of England \u2013 no longer suited Scotland\u2019s circumstances\u2026",
        "They might start to doubt Scotland\u2019s commitment to any such currency union.",
        "Financial market speculation could lead to capital flight and higher interest rates\u2026",
        "And ultimately, if those markets weren\u2019t calmed\u2026",
        "We could exit the currency union, adopt our own currency in a time of crisis.",
        "Don\u2019t think that wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t happen to us\u2026",
        "It was only twenty years ago that we fell out of the ERM.",
        "The euro area is moving towards greater political and fiscal integration in response to the crisis\u2026",
        "But \u2013 in the event of independence\u2026",
        "Rather than seeing greater integration\u2026",
        "Scotland and the continuing UK would be moving in the opposite direction\u2026",
        "Would this be a credible basis for a currency union?",
        "So-called \u201csterlingisation\u201d is what Montenegro does with the Euro.",
        "Literally importing the currency of a foreign country \u2013 in this case the UK pound.",
        "There are a very few examples where countries have made such an arrangement work\u2026",
        "The most famous is probably Panama, where they use the US dollar.",
        "But any historians in the room will know what happened in the 1690s\u2026",
        "The last time Scotland looked towards Panama for its economic future.",
        "More fundamentally, adopting another currency like this would be a mortal threat to Scotland\u2019s financial services sector.",
        "This isn\u2019t a situation where we can be wise after the event.",
        "Where people can realise the impact of their decision, and rescind their vote.",
        "The referendum won\u2019t be like a general election, where if you don\u2019t like the government that\u2019s been elected you\u2019ll get another go in five years.",
        "If Scotland leaves the UK there will be no going back.",
        "It is absolutely clear to me that the only way for Scotland to keep the pound as it is now\u2026",
        "\u2026is for Scotland to stay in the UK.",
        "Anything else is wishful thinking at best.",
        "As one of the Scottish members of the UK government\u2026",
        "Let me say this clearly.",
        "It would be very foolish for anyone to vote for an independent Scotland, on the basis that they will get to keep the pound.",
        "The truth is that a currency union may not be in the interests of either the continuing UK or of Scotland\u2026",
        "It is highly unlikely in practise that a currency union could be made to work\u2026",
        "And it is therefore highly unlikely that a currency union would be agreed.",
        "Now, I plan on unashamedly using every opportunity I have over the next year\u2026",
        "Be they meetings or speeches or TV appearances\u2026",
        "Weddings, christenings, plane journeys \u2013 where you have a captive audience!",
        "To talk about the issue of independence.",
        "Because this is \u2013 quite simply \u2013 the biggest choice our country will ever take\u2026",
        "And as such we all have a responsibility to make sure that the Scottish people have as much access\u2026",
        "To the information\u2026",
        "And the arguments\u2026",
        "As possible.",
        "So I thank you \u2013 again \u2013 for your influential involvement in the debate so far\u2026",
        "I hope that you will all remain involved in the debate\u2026",
        "As we move towards this huge decision.",
        "And I\u2019ll look forward to hearing all of your questions",
        "And \u2013 no doubt \u2013 seeing you politely decline the seat next to me on flights!",
        "Thank you."
