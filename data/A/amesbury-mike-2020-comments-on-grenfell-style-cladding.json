    "content": [
        "Three years on from the Grenfell tragedy, it shames Ministers that their target for removing Grenfell-style cladding from buildings has been missed by such a large margin. Hundreds of tower blocks are still wrapped in deadly flammable cladding.",
        "Today should have marked the end of a three-year nightmare for residents across the country. Instead, they will go to sleep tonight in unsafe buildings due to government inaction.",
        "Ministers should now live up to the promises made last year, and take enforcement action against building owners who are failing to do this work."
