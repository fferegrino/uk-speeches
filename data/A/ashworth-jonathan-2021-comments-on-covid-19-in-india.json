        "Given our deep links with India, the UK cannot remain on the side lines. This pandemic has been a stark reminder of the interconnected nature of our world and the impact events on the other side of the globe can have here in the UK. Nowhere is safe until everywhere safe. The virus and its variants cannot be defeated by the individual efforts of nations alone.",
        "The crisis reminds us of the power of international collaboration and the importance of standing in solidarity with our global partners in the fight against this disease."
