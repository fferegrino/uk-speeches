    "content": [
        "Another topic of concern is crime: would Anderson support the return of the death penalty? \u2018Yes. Nobody has ever committed a crime after being executed. You know that, don\u2019t you? 100 per cent success rate.\u2019 He pauses. \u2018Now I\u2019d be very careful on that one because you\u2019ll get the certain groups saying: \u201cYou can never prove it.\u201d Well, you can prove it if they have videoed it and are on camera \u2013 like the Lee Rigby killers. I mean: they should have gone, same week. I don\u2019t want to pay for these people.\u2019 He has his own experiences with crime to share, having received \u2018a couple of death threats\u2019 which are being investigated by the police, and an attempt at blackmail, too. \u2018I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re blackmailing me over, I just passed it straight to the police.\u2019"
