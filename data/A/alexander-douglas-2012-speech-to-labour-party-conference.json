        "Conference, this has been an important debate. And as this video reminds us, it comes after an extraordinary summer.",
        "Now I know it\u2019s customary to close these debates by quoting past speakers \u2013 and there have been some great contributions this morning.",
        "But I want to begin my remarks by reminding you of the words, not of a politician, or even an activist, but of an athlete.",
        "Because the quiet but fierce pride so many of us felt about Britain this summer was best captured for me when a journalist asked Mo Farrah:",
        "\u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather have run for Somalia?\u201d",
        "Mo replied, \u201cLook mate. This is where I grew up, this is my country and when I put on my Great Britain vest I\u2019m proud. I\u2019m very proud.\u201d",
        "Let\u2019s just contrast those words with the most famous, or should I say infamous, remarks by a Conservative politician this summer, Mr Aiden Burley\u2026..",
        "Remember him?",
        "And what was his reaction to Danny Boyle\u2019s extraordinary evocation of our islands\u2019 story that fittingly celebrated the Suffragettes and the Trade Unionists, the Windrush and our NHS?",
        "He didn\u2019t feel proud like the rest of us.",
        "He called it \u201cLefty multi-cultural crap\u201d.",
        "Now the reason I remind you of these revealing remarks is that this is quintessentially Conservative. This \u2018stop the modern world we want to get off\u2019 attitude doesn\u2019t just appear when the world comes to Britain \u2013 but alas it is also present when the British Government reaches out to the world.",
        "Conference, modern Britain exists in a world where everyone is connected to everyone \u2013 a world of quite extraordinary interdependence.",
        "And the fundamental weakness with this Conservative Government\u2019s foreign policy is that they remain damagingly unreconciled to that modern truth.",
        "Let me be clear: the Foreign Secretary \u2013 he\u2019s not a stupid man.",
        "Indeed he\u2019s an intelligent man.",
        "The problem is he, like all the rest of them, are in hoc to a dumb ideology.",
        "\u2018You are on your own\u2019 is a hopeless idea on which to base a Government\u2019s domestic policy.",
        "But it\u2019s also a hopeless idea on which to base a Government\u2019s foreign policy.",
        "Take the issue of Europe \u2013 does it matter to Britain? Absolutely.",
        "Does it need fundamental reform? Certainly.",
        "Does this Government have a clue how to influence that reform? Absolutely not.",
        "We all know real change is coming, so as Labour, under Ed\u2019s leadership, we\u2019ll argue for reform in Europe, not exit from Europe.",
        "Why?",
        "Because British jobs, British exports, and British influence all benefit from Britain\u2019s continued membership of the European Union.",
        "Remember this when we hear the boast and the bluster from David Cameron trying to placate his backbenchers on Europe next week.",
        "The real tragedy is the Conservatives have marginalised Britain just when influence matters most.",
        "Because when you start with a bunch of Aiden Burleys on the back benches you end up with the fiasco last December of a front bench that does indeed manage to unite Europe\u2026..but the only problem is \u2013 they unite them against Britain.",
        "Just two years into Government and that\u2019s David Cameron in a nutshell: out of touch at home; out of his depth abroad.",
        "But what\u2019s the Conservatives\u2019 strategy for the EU? Nothing, it\u2019s a blank page.",
        "What\u2019s the Conservatives\u2019 strategy for the G20? Nothing, it\u2019s a blank page.",
        "What\u2019s the Conservatives\u2019 strategy for the WTO? Nothing, it\u2019s a blank page.",
        "What\u2019s the Conservatives\u2019 strategy for NATO? Nothing, it\u2019s a blank page.",
        "The Conservatives don\u2019t seem to understand that we are stronger and safer when we cooperate and collaborate with international partners.",
        "And that blindness to the need to network is damaging, and indeed at times dangerous.",
        "David Cameron came to office declaring that Afghanistan would be his number one foreign policy priority.",
        "That\u2019s as it should be. Our troops \u2013 still in harm\u2019s way \u2013 deserve nothing less.",
        "Now we have heard this morning from members of our Armed Forces. They are quite simply the best of British. And we thank them for their service.",
        "But understand this \u2013 they deserve something more than our applause. They deserve a political strategy worthy of their military effort.",
        "And yet the Prime Minister, that self-same Prime Minister who told us Afghanistan would be his Government\u2019s number one foreign policy priority, has not made a speech in the House of Commons on Afghanistan in 14 months. That is shameful.",
        "So today from this platform I say this: David Cameron, break your silence, take the risks to negotiate for a durable peace in Afghanistan, and we in the Opposition will support you.",
        "Now, of course, such an approach will demand Britain works with partners.",
        "And nowhere in the world is that type of coordinated joined-up approach needed more than the Middle East.",
        "Just last week the President Abbas spoke at the United Nations General Assembly and made clear the Palestinians\u2019 wish for enhanced status at the UN.",
        "But where do the British Government stand on this issue?",
        "So far all we\u2019ve heard from them is the sound of silence.",
        "Conference, I give you my word, as a Labour Foreign Secretary, I would not sit on the fence: I would use my voice and my vote to upgrade Palestinian representation at the UN.",
        "Let me be clear. To continue to build settlements on other people\u2019s land is wrong, and it is illegal.",
        "And so too is launching rockets into Israel.",
        "So when people ask you \u2013 which side is Labour on?",
        "Answer them: Labour is on the side of peace and justice, and a negotiated settlement to this conflict. So we will work with our international partners to see not only a secure Israel but a viable Palestinian State.",
        "And we must also work together with our partners on the issue of Iran and its nuclear ambitions.",
        "Let me state this plainly: a pre-emptive strike now by Israel cannot be justified, but nor can Iran\u2019s evasion and hate-filled rhetoric.",
        "The Iranians must face a world united against nuclear proliferation.",
        "Britain must continue to work for a peaceful resolution to this crisis with our international partners led by Cathy Ashton.",
        "And that must continue to be our approach to resolving the crisis in Syria.",
        "On Syria let me say this to the British Government:",
        "The scale of the slaughter and suffering is such that the Government must redouble its efforts to work with international partners to end this violence.",
        "Conference, the long shadow of the last difficult decade has taught us many lessons.",
        "We have to win back trust. I understand that.",
        "So let me say this clearly \u2013 we will always work for peace and only ever contemplate force where we have to.",
        "But for Britain to now try and retreat from the world would be as foolish as it would be futile.",
        "The security and prosperity of each and every citizen of Britain now depends on the security and well-being of those who live far beyond our shores.",
        "It\u2019s not imperial delusions that give you strength in the modern world, it\u2019s the capacity to cooperate and collaborate.",
        "We get that. The Conservatives just don\u2019t.",
        "They are weakening our economy at home.",
        "They are weakening our influence abroad.",
        "They are out of touch at home.",
        "They are out of their depth abroad.",
        "And through our collective endeavour we will work to make sure they\u2019re out of Government come the next election."
