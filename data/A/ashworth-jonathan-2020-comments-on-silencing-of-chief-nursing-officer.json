    "content": [
        "It is scandalous that the nation\u2019s most senior nurse was silenced at the height of the pandemic because she wasn\u2019t prepared to parrot Downing Street spin about Dominic Cummings\u2019 blatant rule breaking.",
        "As the Chief Nursing Officer indicates, it\u2019s unacceptable that\u2019s there was one rule for Johnson\u2019s elite friends and another for the rest of us.",
        "What\u2019s more, it\u2019s astonishing that the Health Secretary refused to explain in the Commons today why he allowed for the chief nurse to be dropped in this way."
