        "The childhood obesity crisis means we need decisive action from Boris Johnson, not more dither and delay.",
        "Ministers promised to tackle our growing obesity crisis but have not implemented a single measure in over two years since the second chapter of the childhood obesity report was published. Ministerial dither is putting children\u2019s health at risk.",
        "Given the fears over the impact of lockdown on obesity levels, it\u2019s urgent that children\u2019s health is now given priority and the action needed is no longer ducked by ministers."
