    "content": [
        "The Government has utterly failed to tackle the building safety crisis. Three years on from Grenfell hundreds of buildings are still covered in the same cladding that caused the Grenfell Tower fire, and thousands are wrapped in other forms of dangerous cladding.",
        "As lockdown restrictions increase across the country, leaseholders will be left trapped in unsafe homes, forced to pay extortionate fees for waking watches.",
        "The Government must urgently accelerate the pace of remediation, and get a grip of the crisis facing leaseholders."
