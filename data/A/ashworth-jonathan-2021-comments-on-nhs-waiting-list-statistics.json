    "content": [
        "The NHS is in crisis. Waiting lists are at record levels with more and more patients forced to pay for operations.",
        "GP numbers have gone down, and it\u2019s no wonder Sajid Javid has run away from defending his latest policy announcement in front of doctors \u2013 his promise is already unravelling.",
        "The money announced today will mean about \u00a333,000 extra per practice; nowhere near enough to deliver the change needed for patients. In 2019 the Tories pledged to deliver 6,000 extra GPs, and ahead of a tough winter, patients are asking why they have broken that promise."
