    "content": [
        "The Government\u2019s response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy has been slow at every stage. They were slow to re-house residents, slow to remove deadly cladding, and slow to come forward with social housing reforms.",
        "Two years late, this white paper appears to water down previous proposals. The Government must do all it can to ensure a disaster like Grenfell can never happen again. That means tackling stigma, putting tenants\u2019 voices centre stage, and ensuring the regulator has real teeth.",
        "Today\u2019s proposals contain nothing to help the thousands struggling in the private rented sector, make up for a lost decade of social housing, or tackle the housing crisis."
