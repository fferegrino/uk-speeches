    "content": [
        "The increasing prevalence of Covid-19 is deeply worrying.",
        "At the start of summer we warned Ministers that an effective test, trace and isolate regime was needed ahead of the autumn. Rather than following our advice Ministers have created a fiasco in testing and contact tracing.",
        "It\u2019s now urgent that an effective locally led public test, trace and isolate service is put in place to drive infections down and keep people safe. The Conservatives\u2019 incompetence cannot hold Britain back from defeating the virus."
