    "summary": "The speech made by Sarah Atherton, the Minister for Defence People, Veterans and Service Families, in Windsor, London on 20 October 2022.",
    "content": [
        "I might not have been a defence minister for very long, but having been a soldier in the Army Intelligence Corps and an Army wife, I know how important decent accommodation is.",
        "It\u2019s not just about making sure the shower works, the roof doesn\u2019t leak, and the kitchen is mould-free, as important as those things are.",
        "It\u2019s about having somewhere that you can look forward to returning to, somewhere you, your partner and your family can call home. In other words, somewhere that doesn\u2019t make you want to ditch the military life in favour of a less exciting but more predictable civilian one.",
        "Your home should incentivise you to pursue a long, rewarding military career, alongside your family. Home is where the heart is \u2013 as clich\u00e9 as it sounds \u2013 so we shouldn\u2019t be surprised if people don\u2019t want to live in below par accommodation.",
        "Thankfully the Defence Secretary, who (to be honest, quite a while ago) lived in these barracks, is determined to get this right. So we talked to service personnel and families. We listened to what they had to say and today I am delighted to launch Defence\u2019s new Accommodation Strategy.",
        "Our plan focuses on three areas:",
        "Firstly, it\u2019s about raising the bar: setting a new minimum standard for Single Living Accommodation across the entire Defence estate.",
        "As a bare minimum we will ensure every room is quiet, secure, dry, well ventilated and heated with access to hot water on demand. That is a minimum. And there\u2019ll be a proactive approach to ongoing maintenance, regularly checking to make sure things don\u2019t go wrong in the first place, with regular upgrades.",
        "I know things have moved on since I was a military wife, so we\u2019ll also be ensuring stronger Wi-Fi connections for all. Which is great news for those who want to video call home or stream online.",
        "And in the coming months and years, we\u2019ll keep talking to our personnel, and their families, to understand how their needs change, and what more can be done.",
        "Secondly, our plan is about fairness.",
        "In the past, subsidised accommodation was divvied-up according to rank. From now on we\u2019re going to ensure it is allocated primarily based on need.",
        "The question we\u2019ll be asking is not how many stripes or pips they have, or how many people they command, but do they have a family? How old are their children? Do they have any special requirements?",
        "Service families\u2019 accommodation will be allocated on individual requirements, not rank. We\u2019re also going to make sure our strategy better reflects the reality of today\u2019s society. That means giving personnel in long-term relationships the same access to accommodation as their married colleagues.",
        "Finally, this plan is about value for money.",
        "We\u2019re dealing with the rising cost of living, and a war in Europe, so we\u2019ve got to get smarter about getting more for our money. This means reducing the current stock in places where beds are continually unused and going empty. It means making our homes more sustainable by increasing their energy efficiency, through better insulation and modern heating systems. And it means future-proofing renovated accommodation with things like electric car charging ports.",
        "It\u2019s no coincidence that we chose these barracks to launch our new Accommodation Strategy today. When Queen Victoria visited, it was in such a state of disrepair, she ordered a complete renovation.",
        "Now we\u2019re ensuring that in today\u2019s Armed Forces, wherever our people live, they will have a place they are proud to call home. Ensuring they are incentivised to do their job to the best of their abilities.",
        "After all, we expect our brave men and women to protect our backs; and the least we can do is show them that we have theirs."
