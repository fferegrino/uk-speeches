    "summary": "The statement issued by the office of Nigel Adams, following allegations made on 10 September 2021.",
    "content": [
        "The gentleman in the blue top hat who Mr Adams directed some colourful language towards is a well-known political activist known as \u2018Stop Brexit Man\u2019.",
        "He has spent the last few years harassing, following and hurling abuse at elected parliamentarians as well as interrupting journalists, preventing some from doing their job of reporting the news and conducting interviews.",
        "Mr Adams\u2019 remarks no doubt reflect those of many democratic representatives trying to deliver on the will of the people and others seeking to go about their business who have been harassed or had their work disrupted by this individual and his handful of followers."
