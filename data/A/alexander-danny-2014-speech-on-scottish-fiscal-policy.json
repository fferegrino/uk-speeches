        "Good morning and welcome.",
        "As you know, today the UK government is publishing the most comprehensive and definitive study of how independence would affect Scotland\u2019s finances over the next 20 years.",
        "I look forward to answering all your questions.",
        "But first I would like to say a few words to set out this analysis.",
        "On the 18th of September we face the most important vote in Scotland\u2019s history.",
        "Whether or not to remain part of the United Kingdom.",
        "It\u2019s a momentous decision.",
        "And in my mind, there is no doubt.",
        "By staying together, the Scottish and the UK economies can continue to grow and prosper.",
        "And as a nation, we can continue to make the choices needed to live within our means and grow our economy.",
        "But I know that many people are still undecided.",
        "And the single biggest question in their minds is\u2026",
        "\u201cWill we be better off together?\u201d",
        "So today\u2026",
        "\u2026I can answer\u2026",
        "\u2026yes, we will be better off.",
        "Because there will be a huge benefit to staying in the United Kingdom\u2026",
        "You could think of it as a \u201cUK Dividend\u201d.",
        "Or 1,400 reasons why we\u2019re better off together.",
        "So what is the UK Dividend?",
        "There is a detailed explanation in the document we are publishing today.",
        "Five key building-blocks underpin our analysis.",
        "There is little dispute about each one of those\u2026",
        "\u2026 because they\u2019re all based on reasonable and responsible assumptions\u2026",
        "\u2026 and all five are seen by independent organisations as significant factors in Scotland\u2019s future. And together they tell a powerful story.",
        "The first building block is what you might call Scotland\u2019s financial starting point.",
        "Should Scotland become independent, it would start off in life in a worse financial position than the UK.",
        "That is the view of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the Centre for Public Policy for Regions, Citigroup and many others.",
        "Even the Scottish government\u2019s own figures show that Scotland would face a shortfall between what the governments gets in tax and what it spends on public services.",
        "So, as a separate country, Scotland would be running a bigger deficit than the UK \u2013 from day one.",
        "Indeed, independent forecasters show that, in 2016, Scotland would be borrowing over 5% of national income.",
        "That is double the deficit of the UK.",
        "And the difference equates to around five and a half billion pounds\u2026",
        "\u2026from day one.",
        "But that\u2019s just the starting point.",
        "The second building block covers the direct cost of setting up a new state.",
        "For example, as an independent country, Scotland would need to set up new institutions.",
        "A new passport office.",
        "A new benefits agency.",
        "Or a new tax collection authority\u2026",
        "\u2026 that last one alone \u2013 as ICAS set out last week \u2013 would cost \u00a3750 million.",
        "We have taken the best independent estimates, which put the cost of transition at up to 1% of GDP.",
        "For Scotland that figure would be \u00a31.5 billion.",
        "At the same time, as a separate country, Scotland would have to pay higher interest rates to borrow in financial markets.",
        "A whole range of experts, from the National Institute to Deutsche Bank, calculate that, under independence, interest rates are likely to be around 1% higher.",
        "That\u2019s worth \u00a3500 million per year in additional debt interest costs.",
        "The third of our five building-blocks is the cost of the Scottish government\u2019s promises.",
        "They\u2019ve set out their policies in the recent White Paper \u2013 but not the costs.",
        "So we\u2019ve looked through the fine print.",
        "Put it through the Treasury\u2019s models.",
        "Using tried and tested methods\u2026",
        "\u2026 and calculated that the Scottish government\u2019s new policies would cost at least \u00a31.6 billion every year.",
        "The fourth factor is the future of oil and gas production.",
        "It is an indisputable fact that North Sea oil production has been declining for many years.",
        "The independent Office for Budget Responsibility has made an impartial assessment of this.",
        "They estimate that oil and gas revenues will fall by around 95%, as a share of our economy, over the next 20 years.",
        "And the fifth factor affecting the future finances of Scotland is our more rapidly ageing population.",
        "This is the well-established view of the UK Statistics Authority, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the International Longevity Centre, and many others.",
        "As Gordon Brown explained last month, the number of Scottish pensioners will rise from 1 million to 1.3 million over the next 20 years.",
        "It means a shrinking number of working age people would have to pay for a growing number of old age pensioners.",
        "So an independent Scotland would have to spend more to deliver the same services as now.",
        "So where does all that leave us?",
        "A worse starting point.",
        "The cost of setting up a new state.",
        "Unfunded policies.",
        "Declining oil revenues and an ageing population.",
        "All of that\u2026",
        "\u2026 easily avoided by staying within the UK\u2026",
        "\u2026 is worth fourteen hundred pounds.",
        "For each person in Scotland\u2026",
        "\u2026 each year\u2026",
        "\u2026for the next 20 years.",
        "That\u2019s the UK Dividend.",
        "And the further ahead you look the more the pressures build.",
        "That dividend\u2026",
        "\u2026 is our share of a more prosperous future.",
        "It is the money that will pay for better public services and a fairer society.",
        "Money for more teachers in better classrooms.",
        "For nurses and midwives.",
        "To put \u00a31,400 per person in context\u2026",
        "On aggregate, it represents 11% of Scotland\u2019s total public expenditure.",
        "That\u2019s equivalent to around two thirds of the total National Health Service budget in Scotland.",
        "It\u2019s almost as much as Scotland\u2019s whole education budget.",
        "So what does \u00a31,400 mean to you and to me?",
        "Well, for example, \u00a31,400 is more than enough to pay for a year of free school meals for three children.",
        "\u00a31,400 pays for 10 weeks of someone\u2019s state pension.",
        "Alternatively, instead of cutting public services to fill the gap, as a separate country, the Scottish government could raise taxes.",
        "For example, today the UK reaches what is known as \u201ctax freedom day\u201d.",
        "That\u2019s the day in the year when, on average, people stop giving their income to the government through tax and instead start keeping the money they\u2019ve earned for the rest of the year.",
        "But, as a separate country, each person in Scotland would have to hand over their income to the state for two more weeks.",
        "Another way an independent Scotland could offset the \u00a31,400 UK Dividend, without cutting public spending\u2026",
        "\u2026 is to increase the basic rate of income tax from 20 to 28%, increase VAT from 20 to 26% and increase duties on alcohol, tobacco and fuel by about 40%.",
        "Of course, the nationalists will say that we\u2019re wrong.",
        "They will just continue to peddle myth after myth\u2026.",
        "\u2026 saying that taxes wouldn\u2019t be higher, that there\u2019s loads of oil left, that public services won\u2019t suffer, that growth will be stronger, that breaking away won\u2019t be hugely expensive, that new institutions can be set up for free\u2026",
        "And all of those myths are refuted by the information we publish today.",
        "And I am very happy to answer questions on all of that.",
        "We are talking about Scotland\u2019s finances over the next 20 years\u2026",
        "\u2026they are talking about what\u2019s happened over the past 5 years.",
        "We are focused on the future \u2013 they are stuck in the past.",
        "To conclude.",
        "Today we have shown that, by staying together, Scotland\u2019s future will be safer, with stronger finances and a more progressive society.",
        "Because as a United Kingdom we can pool resources and share risks.",
        "It means a UK Dividend\u2026",
        "\u2026 of fourteen hundred pounds a year.",
        "For every man, woman and child in Scotland.",
        "And if our history teaches one lesson, it is this\u2026",
        "\u2026 together we achieve so much more than on our own.",
        "So let us look forward to a prosperous and a fair Scotland \u2013 thanks to the dividend that comes from staying in the UK.",
        "And that is why\u2026",
        "\u2026 if you have your doubts\u2026",
        "\u2026 if deep down you feel that we\u2019re better together\u2026",
        "\u2026 today we give you fourteen hundred reasons\u2026",
        "\u2026 why we\u2019re better off together too.",
        "Thank you very much."
