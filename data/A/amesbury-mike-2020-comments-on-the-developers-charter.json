    "content": [
        "This is a Developer\u2019s Charter that will see communities side-lined in decisions and denied vital funding for building schools, clinics and community infrastructure.",
        "These proposals will only serve to blight communities with a new wave of slum housing \u2013 the Government\u2019s own independent report even warned of the poor quality of housing built outside the planning system.",
        "This Government needs to build the high-quality, genuinely affordable, environmentally sustainable housing that this country desperately needs."
