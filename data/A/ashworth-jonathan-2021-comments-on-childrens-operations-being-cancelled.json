    "content": [
        "Reports that urgent children\u2019s operations have been cancelled is deeply alarming; it puts children\u2019s health at risk and reveals the intensity of pressure on the NHS in this wave.",
        "Years of cutbacks, understaffing and underfunding left our NHS vulnerable heading into this pandemic and now swathes of vital non-Covid care are cancelled.",
        "Children must not become the forgotten victims of this crisis. Child health and well-being must always be a priority."
