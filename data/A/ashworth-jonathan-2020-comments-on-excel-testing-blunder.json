    "content": [
        "Because of this Government\u2019s incompetence, there are potentially thousands of people who have been exposed to the virus who could be wandering around not knowing they were exposed and could be infecting people, and the Health Secretary couldn\u2019t even tell us if they\u2019ve been traced. Ministers urgently need to get a grip of their test and trace service."
