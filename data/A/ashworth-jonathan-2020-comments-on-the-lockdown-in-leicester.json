    "summary": "Below is the text of the comments made by Jonathan Ashworth, the Shadow Health Secretary, on 30 June 2020.",
    "content": [
        "The Government\u2019s response to the situation in Leicester has left people anxious and confused.",
        "We support the Government\u2019s decision to reintroduce lockdown restrictions. However, there are a number of outstanding questions about how the Government intends to implement these restrictions and get the outbreak back under control.",
        "There is confusion about essential travel and what it means for people who travel to work outside the boundaries. There is also no clarity about what extra resources will be put in place to increase testing capacity and what financial support will be available to businesses.",
        "The Government must take firm leadership on this. This is the first local lockdown. People in Leicester \u2013 and across the country \u2013 are looking for ministers to take responsibility for this issue.",
        "Number 10 said the afternoon press conferences would now only take place if the Government had \u2018something really important to say\u2019. We believe the situation in Leicester meets that criteria. That is why I am urging the Health Secretary to hold a press conference this afternoon and give the public the answers and reassurance they deserve."
