    "summary": "The comments made by Rosena Allin-Khan, the Shadow Minister for Mental Health, on 24 September 2020. Allin-Khan was commenting on statistics published by the NHS showing over 500,000 sick days had been taken in May 2020 alone.",
    "content": [
        "These statistics must serve as a wakeup call for the Government. At a time when COVID-19 related sickness absences were going down, mental ill health absences were soaring.",
        "Our health and care staff have sacrificed so much during this pandemic \u2013 it demonstrates why Labour\u2019s \u2018Care for Carers\u2019 package is so vital. Dedicated mental health support should be available for all health and care staff.",
        "Since launching the package in June, I have requested meetings with the Government \u2013 it is a disgrace that this offer has not been taken up. I urge the Government to reconsider our offer.",
        "Ahead of winter and a second spike, the Government must learn the lessons of this spring. We must fight for the mental health of those who have supported us so courageously during this crisis."
