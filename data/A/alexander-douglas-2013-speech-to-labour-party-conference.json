        "Conference \u2013 This has been an important debate. And it takes place after an extraordinary year for our country\u2019s Foreign Policy.",
        "Across the Middle East we see a region engulfed by turmoil.",
        "In Syria a hundred thousand have been killed. Millions displaced. A nation state is melting away before our eyes.",
        "And then last month the latest horrific chemical attack took place in Damascus",
        "The Prime Minister announced the recall of Parliament and a Commons motion was drafted authorising British military intervention in Syria.",
        "The UN weapons inspectors had not completed their work. The UN Secretary General was pleading for more time. And the UN Security Council was to be effectively bypassed.",
        "Yet here the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister seemed determined to rush to military action on a timetable agreed elsewhere.",
        "It fell to our leader, Labour\u2019s Leader, Ed Miliband, to speak for the nation.",
        "He upheld a basic principle: that the evidence should precede the decision, not the decision precede the evidence.",
        "And together we set out a \u2018roadmap for decision\u2019: a clear set of tests and conditions by which our nation should reach a decision of such consequence.",
        "Conference, it was Labour\u2019s leadership that prevented a rush to military action on a timetable set elsewhere, without the necessary steps being taken and without due process being followed.",
        "We have learned the lessons of the past. Intervening immediately and asking hard questions later would have ill served our country.",
        "As Labour, we are prepared to support force where we must \u2013 as we did in Libya two years ago \u2013 but we should support diplomacy where we can.",
        "Now, thankfully, a new diplomatic path is open to eradicate chemical weapons in Syria \u2013 in part due to Westminster\u2019s vote.",
        "So in the months ahead we must pursue diplomacy without illusions.",
        "The task now is to ensure that new humanitarian efforts are made, and new diplomatic efforts are taken to get the warring parties around the table, and to end the suffering.",
        "Now some have claimed that the Syria vote means Britain has turned its back on the world. Certainly, people across Britain are weary of conflict.",
        "A decade of brave service by our troops in Afghanistan is drawing to a close.",
        "And of course our economy is fragile.",
        "But that vote told us much more about the competence of this government than it did about the character of our country.",
        "Neither knee jerk interventionism or knee jerk isolationism is the right course for Britain in the 21st century.",
        "It is in our national interest to upload an international rules based order.",
        "And our country is strongest when we work with partners and allies in pursuit of shared goals.",
        "Many on the UKIP right \u2013 whether within or out with the Conservative party \u2013 have reverted to isolationism, we know that.",
        "So as progressive internationalists we must and will reject the isolationism that expresses itself in an anti-Europe, anti-immigrate, anti foreign aid, stop-the-world-we-want-to-get-off type of politics.",
        "We will oppose that politics wherever we find it.",
        "We understand that as a country we face challenges \u2013 from financial contagion to climate change to nuclear threat and conflict \u2013 that spill across borders and defy unilateral solutions.",
        "And only a progressive internationalism can answer that call.",
        "For Britain to now try and retreat from the world would be as foolish as it would be futile.",
        "And that Conference is why Britain\u2019s continued membership of the EU matters so much.",
        "The Eurosceptic fantasy of Britain as a North Atlantic Singapore is just that \u2013 it is a fantasy.",
        "British jobs, British exports and British influence in the world all benefit from Britain\u2019s continued membership of the European Union.",
        "Our economy is strengthened, our interests are advanced, and our voice is heard louder on the world stage as part of the European Union.",
        "And that is why under Ed\u2019s leadership, we will argue for reform in Europe, not exit from Europe.",
        "So Conference, the real problem for the Conservatives on foreign policy isn\u2019t the Prime Minister\u2019s incompetence \u2013 evident though that is \u2013 it isn\u2019t even the rise of isolationism on their backbenches \u2013 evident those that is as well.",
        "It is that these Conservatives are in hoc to an idea \u2013 an imperial delusion \u2013 that is out of balance, and out of step, with the modern world.",
        "They believe that as America pivots towards Asia and the Eurozone consolidates, Britain should simply focus on its own business.",
        "They don\u2019t understand that there is nothing splendid about isolation in the 21st century.",
        "And they don\u2019t understand that Britain is strongest when we work alongside our partners.",
        "Britain stood shoulder to shoulder with our NATO allies against the Soviet Union.",
        "Britain led the development of the single market across Europe.",
        "Britain helped create the United Nations.",
        "Now is the time for a new era of international cooperation.",
        "It is time to lead reforms of Europe and its institutions.",
        "It\u2019s time to strengthen NATO to better coordinate our capabilities amidst tight budgets.",
        "It\u2019s time to deepen our partnerships with Asia, as economic power moves east.",
        "We need that cooperation and that engagement, because \u201cyou are on your own\u201d is as hopeless an idea in foreign policy as it is in domestic policy.",
        "Sadly, the Conservatives just don\u2019t get it.",
        "They have weakened our economy at home and they have weakened our influence abroad.",
        "This is a government that deserves to loose.",
        "Defeating this government is our shared responsibility and working together it can be shared achievement."
