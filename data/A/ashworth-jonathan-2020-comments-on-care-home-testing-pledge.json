    "content": [
        "With infections rising, it\u2019s frankly negligent ministers have failed to deliver on their promise to regularly test care home residents and staff. And to brief newspapers that over-50s may need to shield on the day shielding has been paused causes yet more unnecessary confusion and anxiety.",
        "Ministers have been too slow to act and explain their strategy throughout this pandemic. Test and Trace is costing \u00a310 billion but is nowhere near the \u2018world beating\u2019 system we were promised.",
        "It\u2019s critical measures are now put in place to control the virus including rapidly improving testing and locally-led contact tracing teams. The Government failed to protect care home residents and staff early on in this pandemic. They mustn\u2019t make the same mistake again."
