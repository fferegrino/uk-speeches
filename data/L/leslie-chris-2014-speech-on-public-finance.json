        "During the course of the zero based review discussions I have been having so far with my shadow Cabinet colleagues, it has also struck me how little attention Government departments are paying to the management of long-term future liabilities that are likely to land on the taxpayer. Departments set aside \u2018provisions\u2019 to cover costs for some staggering expenditure possibilities. For instance, the Department for Health currently estimate that clinical negligence liabilities that may arise in future years as a result of NHS litigation could be of the order of \u00a322 billion, with more than \u00a37 billion of this expected to be spent in the next 5 years. And the Department for Energy and Climate Change reckon that the costs of nuclear decommissioning may be as high as \u00a362 billion, a figure that has increased by \u00a310 billion since 2011.
