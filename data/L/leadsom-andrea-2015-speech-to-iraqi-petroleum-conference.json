It has been a steep learning curve over the last couple of weeks, but my previous role as City Minister, as well as spending 25 years in finance prior to becoming an MP, will stand me in good stead.

        "Many other British companies also operate across Iraq in all parts of the energy sector, from production to engineering and the supporting supply chains. They have been at the front of technological expertise and advancements and exploring new methods of best practice, continuing to help strengthen Iraq\u2019s energy sector. For example last year Shell and Petronas were able to start production at Majnoon. As well as increasing production to a target of 1.8million barrels of oil a day by 2017, it has begun the vital process of capturing flared gas, as has the Joint Venture at Basra between Iraq\u2019s South Gas Company, Shell and Mitsubishi Corporation. As you will know flaring is a great waste of resource and money, and causes great damage to the environment. This technology can address this, allowing Iraq to make the most of its energy reserves, diverting the gas for local power generation and export.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education",

        "Fulfilling Iraq\u2019s energy potential is a priority for the whole of Iraq for the UK and for British companies and more broadly for global energy security. As a friend to all of Iraq, the UK stands ready to provide support and cooperation. We are dedicated to working with all parties in tackling the ISIL threat; this is a priority and a strong unified response set on solid economic foundations will prove most effective. Iraq\u2019s significant energy resources have the potential to drive future stability and prosperity, creating jobs and raising living standards for the Iraqi people and I am confident that Iraq will continue to be a great and responsible energy producer, with benefits for all Iraqis.
