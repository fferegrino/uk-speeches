        "The City is the engine of Britain\u2019s financial and legal sectors, driving the economic wellbeing of the nation. In a little more detail, the UK had a trade surplus in the financial and insurance services sector of over \u00a360 billion last year \u2013 overall, it contributed \u00a3124 billion to the UK economy. Of this, London accounts for just over half of the total gross value added \u2013 in the Square Mile alone, some 380,000 people walk into work every day. For every one job created in the City, three more are created in the regions. Legal services are crucial to the City \u2013 indeed, are so closely linked with finance activities as to be interwoven: our strong financial services beget strong legal services, and vice versa. It means that legal services swell the nation\u2019s coffers by around \u00a325 billion pounds and contribute a trade surplus of just over \u00a33 billion. These statistics tell an extraordinary story: that the body that you will lead, the City of London Corporation, is at once a local council and a global powerhouse.

        "It is important that our legal services operate from courts that are fully equipped to deliver 21st century justice. I am delighted that the City of London is to replace all its courts \u2013 barring the Old Bailey, Mr Recorder \u2013 with a high-tech 18-strong courts complex in the heart of legal London, specialising in fraud, economic and cyber-crime. Perfect proof \u2013 if any were needed \u2013 that the City not only moves with the times, but remains well ahead of them. The City leads the world in fintech.

        "My Lord Mayor Elect, you want the issue of public trust to be a key element of your Mayoralty \u2013 specifically, rebuilding relations between the City and the public following the financial crisis of 2008. It is clearly important that there is mutual trust between the public and businesses, and your programme will challenge City firms to connect with communities, operate responsibly and with integrity, and make a positive impact on society and the environment. This of course chimes with the best traditions of the City, stretching back centuries: as a local council, looking after the immediate needs of citizens; as a business hub, attracting the brightest and most innovative talents, and in general promoting knowledge, diversity and culture. Since medieval times, the great livery companies have been generous and enlightened patrons of charities and schools.

        "At the end of your schooldays, My Lord Mayor Elect, you took a gap year.

No matter \u2013 what is of interest to us is not the revenues raised but your subject matter. Not just any buildings \u2013 these were some of the beautiful Wren churches dotted around the City between the Gherkins and Walkie-Talkies.
