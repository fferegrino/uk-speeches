        "It is a great pleasure to be back here at the London School of Economics \u2013 a place which brings back so many happy memories for me. The year I spent here taught me so much \u2013 both in and out of LSE.

        "In a very understated British way, we do not always talk enough about this. Before the ashes of the Second World War had even settled, it was Winston Churchill who made the best case for a united Europe. I read out passages from his 1946 Zurich speech the last time I was here \u2013 it is the most eloquent and powerful case for the European Union you could ever wish to read. And while the UK initially chose to be on the outside, it eventually took its place on the inside \u2013 making us both that much stronger. The relationship may not have always been smooth or perfect \u2013 what relationship ever is.
