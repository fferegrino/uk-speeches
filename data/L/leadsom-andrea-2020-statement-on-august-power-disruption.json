        "On Friday 9 August 2019, over 1 million customers were affected by a major power disruption that occurred across England and Wales and some parts of Scotland.

        "Though the power disruption itself was relatively short-lived\u2014all customers were restored within 45 minutes\u2014the knock-on impacts to other services were significant. This is especially true for rail services which experienced major delays that extended into Sunday 11 August.
