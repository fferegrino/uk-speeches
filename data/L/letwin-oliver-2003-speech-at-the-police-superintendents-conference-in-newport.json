The beat is at the heart of neighbourhood policing, but this is policing with brains too \u2013 as anyone who has seen it succeed in America can tell you. That is why you will not hear me use the term \u201cintelligence-led policing\u201d to refer to conventional policing alone. Each form of policing is as intelligent as the other.

To some, for whom crime is a response to a system of oppression, and for whom the police are agents of those who control the system, neighbourhood policing is seen as something to be expelled from the community.
