        "I have also learned the value of knowing exactly what you are voting for. For example, colleagues, if your Whip tells you, as a newbie MP, to go through the Aye Lobby and vote for something called the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, just say no. The House has learned a lot about \u201cErskine May\u201d, from the precise meaning of \u201cforthwith\u201d to the specific purpose of Standing Order No. 24, and even how a Speaker should vote in the event of a tie.
