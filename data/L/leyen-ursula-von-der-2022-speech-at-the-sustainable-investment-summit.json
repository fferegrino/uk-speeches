        "We are determined to end our dependence on Russian fossil fuels, once and for all, and fast. By diversifying supply, saving energy, and accelerating the roll-out of renewables. Two figures: Last year, 41% of Europe\u2019s gas imports came from Russia. Now, this figure is down to 9% pipeline gas. We were able to compensate these losses through increased supply by our trusted partners \u2013 like the US and Norway. In parallel we have filled our gas storages to over 90%. This is significantly higher than it was last year. And we have managed to save 15% of the gas consumption. But we have to go and steer the medium and long-term transition. We have proposed REPowerEU, an investment support to cut our dependence on Russian fossil fuels by accelerating the deployment of renewables.

To date, the Commission has given the green light to nearly 500 billion euros from NextGenerationEU, of which half support the green transition. This includes measures in sustainable mobility, energy efficiency, and investments in renewables and grids. For example, in France\u2019s plan, 85.000 ecological bonuses have already been disbursed to support the uptake of clean vehicles. And this is just the start. Because much of our public investment is designed to help de-risk and mobilise private capital.

        "Which brings me to my second point: human capital. This is a core theme of today\u2019s summit. And for very good reason. There are entrepreneurs with big projects and dreams, and companies with ambitious plans to decarbonise, who simply cannot find the professionals with the green or digital skills to work with them. In Europe right now, we have the strongest labour market in decades, but at the same time we have a shortage of the right skills. This is a trend that has picked up especially in the last two years, as we recovered from the pandemic lockdowns. The Munich-based IFO Institute has found a growing shortage of skilled workers in almost every EU Member State, across economic sectors \u2013 from manufacturing to services. For example in construction, which is a pivotal sector for the clean energy transition, nearly 35% of EU firms report impairments due to a shortage of skilled workers.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education",
