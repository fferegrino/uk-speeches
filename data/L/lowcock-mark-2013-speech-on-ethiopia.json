        "The first of these features highlighted by the Commission was integration into the global economy. Two aspects of this are particularly important. First is the willingness and ability to import ideas, technology, and know-how from the rest of the world. Second, these countries exploited global demand.

        "Ethiopia is moving towards this kind of integration. It has publicly set a target of joining the WTO. It has a rising export base, including diversifying from traditional crops like coffee into new areas like cut flowers. There\u2019s a booming services sector, to which energy exports could soon become a major contributor. And foreign direct investment is being actively courted.

        "The third feature is a focus on the future and high saving and investment rates.
