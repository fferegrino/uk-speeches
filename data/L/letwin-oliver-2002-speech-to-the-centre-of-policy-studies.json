        "Earlier this year in a speech to the Centre for Policy Studies I observed that growing up in Britain sweeps up many children on a conveyor belt of crime without offering any exit routes. This is a conveyor belt that starts with individuals growing up in disruptive homes. They become an inconvenience and a problem in school. They start a life of petty crime and move on to serious crime. They begin their prison sentence, come out and repeat the offence. They are given a longer prison sentence and they become hardened criminals. Institutionalisation is then the only option left.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education",
        "This was described recently by the Metropolitan Commissioner, Sir John Stevens, when he said: \u201cThe next generation of children could be growing up in an environment where crime is seen as unexceptional in some areas of large cities \u2013 just a part of everyday life\u2026\u2026\u2026.the bullied become bullies, the beaten become aggressors, and cruelty becomes the norm.
