Indeed, to refuse it would be unthinkable. Ours is a profession whose invitations are sometimes issued in the same spirit of tolerance as the manager of Glasgow Rangers might expect if asked to speak to the supporters of Glasgow Celtic.

Two of my grandparents were collectors for friendly societies.
