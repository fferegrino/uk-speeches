        "Long term unemployment remains persistent and the Government\u2019s Plan for Jobs has done nothing to alleviate supply shortages or prepare for the future.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Families and businesses are facing an energy crisis, shortages and price rises because of this Government\u2019s poor decisions and lack of planning.
