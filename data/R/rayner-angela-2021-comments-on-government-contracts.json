        "The Prime Minister needs to answer why the Government appears to have lied to the public to cover up the dodgy dealings of Tory Ministers.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Tories think there is one rule for them and another for everyone else. Billions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money has been wasted because of Ministers handing out cash to their mates instead of putting the public interest first. Ministers must now publish every Test and Trace contract and all correspondence showing how that contract was agreed so we can get to the bottom of this racket.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
