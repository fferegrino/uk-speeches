        "This giant lorry park will stand as a symbol of the Government\u2019s failure to plan properly for Brexit, with so little achieved in four years and only five months to go before the end of the transition period.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Ministers need to explain how much this park will cost and how it will operate, and reassure residents who understandably fear it will make their lives a misery.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "When Boris Johnson talked about relaxing planning laws, no one thought he meant turning part of the Garden of England into a lorry park the size of about 15 football pitches.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Prime Minister promised an \u2018oven-ready\u2019 deal and said there would be extra cash for major projects. No one imagined that meant concreting over the countryside to build a lorry park.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
