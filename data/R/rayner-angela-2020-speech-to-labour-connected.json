        "You have rightly been praised as heroes this year. But the truth is that you have always been heroes. You\u2019ve always been the backbone of our country and of our communities.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Before I became an MP I was a home carer, working nights in Stockport on poverty pay and a zero-hours contract.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "The Health Secretary admitted he couldn\u2019t live on Statutory Sick Pay of \u00a394 pounds a week.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "On Wednesday, the Prime Minister couldn\u2019t even say how much the average social care worker was paid. He had no idea.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "And we will fight to make sure that every worker earns a decent wage for their work.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Fight for the nurses, midwives, hospital porters and other NHS staff who were denied a pay rise earlier this year.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And fight any attempt to freeze the minimum wage.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And who could be better suited to rebuilding our communities and our country than the key workers who have got us through this crisis?\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That is why, working with our trade union movement, we are supporting key workers who want to run for office in May 2021 and beyond.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "You kept our country running. Now we want you to lead the recovery in every town hall and in every community.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "And we will call this failing Conservative government out for its serial incompetence that is holding Britain back.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The coronavirus crisis has changed everything for all of us, for our country and for our Party. But our values haven\u2019t changed.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And it is those values of fairness and compassion that are seeing our country through this crisis.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Our key workers have answered the call, our public services have risen to the challenge, and the British people have shown the Tories beyond all doubt that Thatcher was wrong and there IS such a thing as society.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "A society in which people come together to support each other and have each other\u2019s backs.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "Because I was born in Stockport, but I was made in our movement. I never went to university, but when I joined my union I found an education and a vocation.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Together we are strong, and in the months ahead our movement will need all of our collective strength as we fight to save jobs and protect our communities.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "As a single mum, he said my children would grow up \u201cill-raised, ignorant, and illegitimate\u201d.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "He only knows one approach. Denying that problems exist and then blaming other people for his own incompetence.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We are facing a second spike, further restrictions and the prospect of another national lockdown because of his failure and incompetence.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "Yet it\u2019s always someone else\u2019s fault. Civil servants. The public health body they voted to create in the first place.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Or even the public \u2013 for doing the right thing and trying to get a Covid test.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
