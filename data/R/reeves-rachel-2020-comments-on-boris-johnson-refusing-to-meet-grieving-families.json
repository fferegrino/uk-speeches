        "These revelations that bereaved families had to write to Boris Johnson five times asking to meet him \u2013 for him to privately go back on his public word and refuse are astounding, and upsetting for so many whose families and lives have been impacted by COVID in this way.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "41,504 people have tragically lost their lives to this virus. The very least the Prime Minister could do is respond truthfully to their families, and have the heart to meet some of them and their representatives.\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Prime Minister has been going back on his word all summer \u2013 but to not even meet with grieving families hits a new low.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
