        "This report confirms that this Tory government\u2019s approach to procurement has fallen far short of what this country deserves. Lessons must be learned.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The National Audit Office has shown how, at best, this incompetent government can\u2019t even get basic paperwork right.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "At worst, that the government may be deliberately attempting to cover their tracks, avoid scrutiny or withhold information from the public while wasting taxpayer money.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "From paying for useless PPE to a maintaining Serco\u2019s failed contract tracing system, we have seen disastrous decisions which have squandered public money and held back our country\u2019s response to Covid-19.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The country deserves to have confidence their money is being spent effectively by the government \u2013 and to know without doubt that friends and donors to the Conservative party aren\u2019t profiting from this pandemic.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
