        "Beijing\u2019s decision to impose radical changes to restrict participation in Hong Kong\u2019s electoral system constitutes a further clear breach of the legally binding Sino-British Joint Declaration.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This is part of a pattern designed to harass and stifle all voices critical of China\u2019s policies and is the third breach of the Joint Declaration in less than nine months.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Chinese authorities\u2019 continued action means I must now report that the UK considers Beijing to be in a state of ongoing non-compliance with the Joint Declaration \u2013 a demonstration of the growing gulf between Beijing\u2019s promises and its actions.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The UK will continue to stand up for the people of Hong Kong. China must act in accordance with its legal obligations and respect fundamental rights and freedoms in Hong Kong.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
