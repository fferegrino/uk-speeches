        "The Conservatives have shown complete disregard for working people by wasting taxpayers\u2019 money on dodgy contracts. Whether it was useless PPE or the billions that went down the drain on Test and Trace, they\u2019ve shown that they are out for themselves and can\u2019t be trusted to stand up for working people.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Even as the Government is hitting working families with an unfair tax hike and household bills are soaring, the Conservatives continue to give billions of pounds out to their friends and donors.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Government should have long since ended the emergency rules that gave \u2018VIP access\u2019 to public contracts and they now need to say how they will recover the public money that has been handed out to their cronies for unusable PPE or undelivered services.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
