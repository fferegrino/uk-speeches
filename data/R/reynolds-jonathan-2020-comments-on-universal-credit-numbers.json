        "Britain is in the midst of a jobs crisis. As Universal Credit hits 5.5 million the Government must reconsider its position on sanctions and conditionality, which risk plunging millions into hardship and do nothing to help people back to work.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "In particular, it is extremely worrying that this increase in unemployment has hit older workers, the self-employed and part-time workers hardest.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Every job lost is a tragedy and we must do all we can to safeguard people\u2019s livelihoods. The Government must wake up to the scale of this crisis and adopt a more flexible approach targeted at the sectors who need it most.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Labour believes Universal Credit should be replaced with a system which offers a proper social security safety net and decent support to all.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
