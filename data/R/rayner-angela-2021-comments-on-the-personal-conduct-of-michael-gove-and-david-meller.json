        "It shows just how engulfed in corruption this government is that the Minister in charge of procurement and ensuring that contracts are awarded to the best bidder and represent value for money for the taxpayer was helping his own donor to get VIP fast-track access to contracts.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Michael Gove stood up in Parliament and said that all contracts were awarded through the same process. He must have known that wasn\u2019t true when he said it because he had already helped his mate gets tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It is time this corrupt government published the full details of every PPE and testing contract awarded to companies with links to the Conservative Party, Conservative Ministers and Conservative MPs so we can get to the bottom of the lobbying, dodgy deals and special favours that have been done using taxpayers\u2019 money like a get-rich-quick scheme for Conservative donors and mates.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
