        "The Conservatives\u2019 council tax rise will hit families right at the very time millions are worried about the future of their jobs and how they will get through the next few months.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "With Britain having experienced the worst recession of any major economy this is simply the wrong time for this tax rise. This Government should not be making families pay the price for their mishandling of the Covid crisis and their broken promises to support councils.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Prime Minister must cancel this hike. If he refuses, Conservative MPs will have the opportunity to vote with Labour to protect family incomes and secure our economy.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
