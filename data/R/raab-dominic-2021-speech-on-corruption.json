        "It stunts development, it drains poorer nations of their wealth, and keeps their people trapped in poverty.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Over 2% of global GDP is lost to corruption every single year.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
