        "By letting Hammond off the hook, the Government has muzzled its own watchdog. Even when their own hand-picked anti-corruption tsar, a former Tory Cabinet Minister, asks them to take action over a flagrant breach of the rules they have outright refused.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This is just the latest evidence that Boris Johnson will not tackle the corruption that has engulfed his Government and the Conservative Party. Instead of enforcing the rules he breaks the rules himself, tries to change the rules and defends senior Conservatives who break the rules.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The system is completely broken and this Government will not close the revolving door between public office and cushy lobbying gigs.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
