Is it for tariffs or no tariffs with the EU?\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The government is rebadging a basic element of preparation but still can\u2019t tell us how many customs agents are recruited or trained or whether crucial IT is ready.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "With glaring questions like these still unanswered, this government must do much more than just \u2018demand action\u2019 from UK businesses, already under huge pressure from the pandemic \u2013 and instead provide them with some much needed answers.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
