        "Well, Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Congratulations on arriving at the conference.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "In spite of the best efforts of Mick Lynch, who seemed to wish to get in the way.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But thank you for being here, because you are the beating heart of the Conservative Party, you\u2019re the stalwarts who do all the work for us and ensure people like me get elected.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So, I thank you for all you do for conservatism, and supporting us so much. And you make it work, you ensure we have Conservative governments, and your getting here is proof of that.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I must say, I think the unions need some of my little calling cards saying \u201cI look forward to seeing you back at work soon\u201d.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Because actually, we have a tireless quest for productivity in this country, and we need to make sure that everyone is working efficiently, and we obviously want them to be working in their proper places of work.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Also, thank you for giving me almost as warm a welcome as I got outside the hall.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I think that\u2019s rather marvellous. I happen to think that having a democracy where you can actually walk through the streets and people can exercise their right to peacefully protest, shows the strength of our society.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And if people want to call me \u201cTory scum\u201d, I don\u2019t mind!\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And it has to be said, walking through the beautiful streets of Birmingham, turned blue once again- or turning blue once again- thanks to the great efforts of Andy Street; is a great privilege, and it\u2019s lovely to be here, and to be here with this fantastic audience, and to be speaking to you as Business Secretary.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I\u2019m going to reintroduce a great tradition that Secretaries of State used to have when they came to the Conference, by introducing my brilliant ministerial team.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So, my fellow Cabinet member Graham Stuart, Minister for Climate; Jackie Doyle-Price, who is here as Minister for Industry; Nusrat Ghani, Minister for Science and Investment Security; Dean Russell, Minister for Enterprise and Markets; and Lord Callanan, who I can\u2019t actually see here but is nonetheless a great man, is Minister for Business, Energy and Corporate Responsibility.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I am so lucky to be supported by what I think is the \u2018A-Team\u2019 of ministers, and you can tell that to all the other departments who only have \u2018B-Teams\u2019. So, let\u2019s be clear that I have the \u2018A-Team\u2019 supporting me.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It\u2019s also quite fun to be speaking, for the first time in all the years I\u2019ve been a Member of Parliament, from the main stage. I did once in the old days, when I was the candidate in Wrekin, get up to the main stage, but that was only for about three minutes, and I\u2019ve got a bit longer now.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It makes a change, I used to do the rounds of the fringes. Sometimes, I wasn\u2019t entirely in line with what the Government was doing, and leaving the fringes to certain other Right Honourable Friends of mine, who seem to be having a jolly time.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Instead, I am here in full support, and honoured to serve a first-class Prime Minister.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And the Prime Minister, since she took office, has completed about a years\u2019 Government business in a fortnight. And I\u2019m glad to say I think the Prime Minister- and I say this as the Minister for Energy- is a genuine dynamo and is producing electric fields that are making sure things get done.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And she knows how urgent the challenges we face are.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "**Energy**\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And the challenges are particularly in energy: first, affordability this winter; second, securing energy supplies; and third, what I would like to call Intelligent Net Zero.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And how we are tackling those challenges? Rapidly is the answer.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "While the Opposition sniped, and cat-called, and did what it usually does, we got on with it.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We worked properly, night and day. And actually, the Civil Servants in BEIS worked incredibly hard to create the Energy Price Guarantee for households and the Energy Bill Relief Scheme for businesses.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We have ensured that the British people \u2013 families and businesses  \n\u2013 will get help now, form the First of October with the energy price support that took effect on Saturday, regardless of where they live in the United Kingdom and however they get their energy.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "His Majesty\u2019s Government has acted with speed and foresight to deliver this protection for households throughout the entire Kingdom.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Thank you, somebody agrees with me! You\u2019ve all been here a very long time so the fact that one person is paying attention is a great relief.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The same is true for businesses, and we have averted genuine economic disaster by protecting businesses, charities and public services including schools and hospitals, and particularly care homes, from catastrophic rises in their energy costs.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We did this because of Putin\u2019s monstrous invasion of Ukraine. He seems to want to make Ivan the Terrible look like Padre Pio.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "His wicked acts forced up the price of gas to an extent that would have ruined almost every business and left virtually every family unable to afford their energy. I actually said a journalist from the Sun, the only person who could have afforded an energy bill this winter would\u2019ve been the proprietor of the Sun, and everybody else would\u2019ve been in penury.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And that\u2019s why, ladies and gentlemen, we have done what we have done, not some blunt instrument that our socialist counterparts would have used.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But a well-designed, and effective way, of getting support to all. And a support that will decline as the energy price normalises.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Now, you are proper conservatives, aren\u2019t you? You are the bluest of the blue.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And there may be some of you who think it\u2019s not conservative to intervene in this way.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But I would say that there was no question that we had to come to the British people\u2019s aid. We could not let the people face this winter alone.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This is actually what the state fundamentally is there for: to do things that people cannot do themselves.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Some burdens are too great for individuals and families to bear and these must be borne by the nation herself \u2013 these are the burdens of security, of policing, of defence.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This intervention is an act of defence for our people, every bit as much as making munitions or tanks.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And our great hero, and I\u2019m sure this man is a great hero of many of you: Adam Smith himself, the father of free marketeers, the pater familias of economic theory, put the defence of the nation above all else.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "He told that the Navigation Acts, which you\u2019ll all recall from your O-Level history, against the Dutch.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It\u2019s quite interesting, you know all those things we say about \u2018Dutch courage\u2019 and so on all come from the 17th century wars we fought against the Dutch.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But he said the Navigation Acts were \u201cwisest of all the commercial regulations of England\u201d because they stopped a then-hostile nation \u2013 and just for the record, we are now very friendly with the Dutch- harming Britain.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "**Defence**\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u201cDefence\u201d, Adam Smith said, was \u201cof much more importance than opulence\u201d. He meant it was worth the short-term cost to defend Britain from \u201cnational animosity\u201d.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And as so often what was true in the 18th century is true today.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The war may not be on our shores, but we will defend the United Kingdom against Mr Putin\u2019s evil.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Our decisive action will save millions of families and businesses from penury.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And do you know what, imitation is the greatest form of flattery\u2013 we\u2019re being imitated by our German friends who have rolled out almost a carbon copy scheme.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So, this intervention helping families across the country from falling into debt and misery through crippling energy costs imposed on them by a tyrant in Moscow, has averted a disaster for Britain\u2019s small businesses this winter, salvaging the livelihoods that would have been destroyed.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So this winter, we are once again standing together with the British people.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But there is more to do, because we have to make sure that this does not occur again.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We must act to provide energy security, and to use our energy better.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But the more we produce, the more affordable our scheme will become.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Energy supply, cheap energy, is the foundation of our prosperity.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Our reserves of coal and the pursuit of new technologies to dig it out,\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I\u2019m going back to history; I\u2019m not advocating going back to coal now,\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Digging it out of the ground spurred the Industrial Revolution.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The discovery of North Sea oil and gas, combined with Mrs Thatcher\u2019s visionary leadership, turbocharged the British economy in the 1980s.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Now our future prosperity depends on our ability to secure affordable energy in abundance.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "High energy costs have made our industries uncompetitive and increased the cost of building roads and railways.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "They have often meant the difference between businesses choosing to invest in the UK or turning their backs.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So the Energy Supply Taskforce, led by the esteemed Maddie McTernan, who delivered the vaccines that rescued us from the Covid pandemic, and she is moving to secure our energy supply in the coming months.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Our aim is to secure cheap and plentiful supplies of energy, the veritable engine of economic growth.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Now that may lead Socialist commentators to paint me as a fossil fuel junky.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But I am neither a fossil fuel junky, nor a junky of any other variety.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Let me reassure you. I am committed to Net Zero by 2050.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But the green agenda does not mean an agenda of poverty. It does not contradict the growth agenda.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We will go green in a way that makes the British people better off not worse off, drives growth instead of hindering it, and levels-up, by boosting industries in our regions instead of imposing costs that drive them to the brink of ruin.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The faddish, Islingtonian Labour Party was happy to destroy industries like steel by imposing needless costs on their energy: this wasn\u2019t just unfair, it was un-green, and simply forced manufacturing overseas, making us import more polluting products.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We need intelligent greenery not religious zealotry.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "As for the socialist ideas of a nationalised energy dream:\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "it will lead to nothing but shortages, rationing and intermittency.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Ladies and Gentlemen, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard me called the Right Honourable Member for the Eighteenth Century. But it\u2019s not an insult to me.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Georgians were pioneers, innovators, inventors of the power loom and the spinning jenny, the fathers of the industrial revolution.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Think of Jethro Tull, whose seed drill transformed agriculture \u2013 some of you thought I was talking about a pop star but actually I was talking about agricultural innovation.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Or of Matthew Boulton of this great city, who with James Watt developed the steam engine that powered the Industrial Revolution.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It is that same spirit of progress this government must capture.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That is why we are moving full steam ahead with carbon capture and storage, expanding the world\u2019s biggest windfarm at Dogger Bank, developing hydrogen and nuclear, including modular nuclear reactors.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But perhaps the most exciting is fusion.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Now, bear in mind, Isaac Newton believed in the Philosophers Stone and thought you could turn base metals into gold, so fusion is a great hope, a potential ace up our sleeve, but it would be silly of me to pretend it\u2019s not difficult.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It offers unparalleled potential for clean power production, promising a future of inexhaustible energy that could unshackle us from hydrocarbons,\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "and make us truly self-sufficient and secure.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "This is what I mean about intelligent net zero. It\u2019s about making decisions that reduce carbon but make us more prosperous.
