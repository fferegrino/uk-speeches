        "When I visited Sudan in January I announced the UK\u2019s intent to support Sudan\u2019s path to debt relief as Prime Minister Hamdok delivers much needed reforms in support of the country\u2019s economic revival and transition to democracy.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Today the UK has delivered on that commitment by providing a \u00a3148m bridging loan that has enabled Sudan to clear its arrears at the African Development Bank. I would like to thank His Excellency Finance Minister Gibril Ibrahim, and African Development Bank Director General Nnenna Nwabufo and their teams for their hard work to make this happen.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The UK is proud to have facilitated Sudan\u2019s arrears clearance with the AfDB, which enables access to much needed additional financing and we look forward to continuing our work with Sudan and international partners on debt relief so they can rejoin financial markets and deliver the aspiration expressed so clearly by the Sudanese people for a better future.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
