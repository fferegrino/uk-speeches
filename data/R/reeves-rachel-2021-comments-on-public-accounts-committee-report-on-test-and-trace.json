        "It underlines the epic amounts of waste and incompetence, an overreliance on management consultants, taxpayers\u2019 cash splashed on crony contracts, all while ministers insist our NHS heroes deserve nothing more than a clap and a pay cut.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Conservatives\u2019 wasteful obsession with outsourcing must end and contact tracing should be run by our public health teams.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
