        "I write following the revelation that refurbishments to the Prime Minister\u2019s flat were funded via a loan from the Conservative Party.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Prime Minister\u2019s then Press Secretary, Allegra Stratton, is reported to have told lobby journalists during an official briefing on 8 March: \u201cConservative Party funds are not being used to pay for any refurbishment of the Downing Street estate.\u201d When asked about the matter today, the Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman reportedly declined to correct the record and come clean about the donation.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "As a Special Adviser, Allegra Stratton is bound by the Civil Service Code which sets out standards of integrity and honesty required from public officials. Therefore, I would urge you to build into your review an investigation into whether the former Press Secretary knowingly misled journalists and the public, or was misled herself by senior members of the government who seem intent on a cover up.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "In order to maintain public trust, it is vital that the government publishes the long delayed List of Ministers\u2019 Interests and the details of who paid for Boris Johnson\u2019s flat.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
