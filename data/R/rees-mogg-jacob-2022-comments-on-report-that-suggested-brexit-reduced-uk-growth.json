        "In a report gullibly swallowed by the remainiacs it models what would have happened to the UK economy had it remained in the European Union. It calls this a \u201cdoppelganger\u201d method. Inevitably for such an organisation it produces a negative result. However, its methodology is not only flawed but absurd.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Buried in the text is the admission that \u201cthe doppelganger grew a little faster than the UK before 2009\u201d \u2013 an admission which makes the whole exercise valueless.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Even more preposterously it claims that Brexit has a cost that existed even when the UK was in the EU. If our economy grew less quickly than it ought to have done when we were in why is Brexit responsible for our current level of growth?\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
