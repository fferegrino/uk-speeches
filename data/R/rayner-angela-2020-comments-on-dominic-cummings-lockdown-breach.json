        "The Dominic Cummings saga has already done incredible damage to public trust, and the public are rightly angry that there is one rule for the Prime Minister\u2019s chief advisor and one for the rest of us.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Dominic Cummings has said that there are photos and data proving that he is was in London on the 19th April, and the Prime Minister has said that he has seen this evidence. The public have a right to know whether the Prime Minister\u2019s chief advisor made a second lockdown-breaching trip to Durham, and it is surely therefore only right that this evidence is produced.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "If Dominic Cummings was in London during both the morning and afternoon of the 19th April, and not in Durham as has been alleged, I\u2019m sure that he the Prime Minister will welcome this opportunity to set the record straight.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
