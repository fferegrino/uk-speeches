        "After waiting over two years for this to be published by the Government, the review and its recommendations do not go far enough.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Rape prosecutions are at a record low, only one in 60 rapes are leading to a charge and this review was meant to understand the failings of the criminal justice system, and set out the Government\u2019s plan to reverse the worrying deterioration of rape charges, prosecutions and conviction levels. The Government have failed to do that, and it has failed victims of rape on every front \u200bby pushing the justice system to the brink of collapse through a decade of cuts to police, courts and the CPS.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This review was a real opportunity to improve the criminal justice system for victims of rape, and it has missed that opportunity. The Government should urgently introduce Labour\u2019s root and branch reforms to support rape victims, instead of piecemeal pilots and \u200btinkering that will not do enough to fix the Government\u2019s \u200bfailure to support rape victims.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
