        "Ladies and Gentlemen, I want to start by taking you back 15 years to the year 2000, the first year of the new millennium.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It was the year the Spice Girls broke up. The year Chris Evans stopped making TFI Friday. It was the year we partied to see in the millennium.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But what is the significance of this milestone year for us today?\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "**The offshore wind success story**\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Well it\u2019s this.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "At the turn of the century, do you know how much UK electricity offshore wind was providing?\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "None. None what so ever.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Then, at the end of 2000, off the coast of Northumberland, the Blyth pilot project got up and running.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The UK\u2019s first offshore wind farm. With just two turbines, the largest turbines in the world at the time, producing just 4MW of electricity.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And from small seeds, orchards grow.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The last 15 years has seen a phenomenal growth in British offshore wind.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "By the end of this year we are expecting 30 offshore wind farm developments to be contributing to Britain\u2019s energy security.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Almost 1,500 turbines with the capacity to provide over 5GW of home produced, clean electricity \u2013 enough to power the equivalent of almost 4 million homes.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "In the last 5 years alone, the amount of electricity being produced from offshore wind has more than quadrupled.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "In the same period we have seen around \u00a310bn of private sector investment.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And the industry now supports around 14,000 jobs.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So you represent one of the 21st century industrial success stories.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "And that is where 21st century industrial Britain should be \u2013 leading the world.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "As our friends over at the Department for Business would say \u2013 Britain is Great.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So today I want to talk about how we build on that success.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "First \u2013 deployment and investment \u2013 keeping up the pace we have set to maintain our world leading status.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Second \u2013 costs \u2013 bringing them down so offshore wind becomes more and more competitive, requiring less and less public support, so the future is sustainable and subsidy free.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And third \u2013 economic benefit \u2013 making sure that this success delivers economic benefits throughout the UK \u2013 into local host communities, through the supply chain to the wider country.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But first, let me remind you all why we are doing all this.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "**Energy security, global security**\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Britain is upgrading its energy infrastructure.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "To replace power stations reaching the end of their natural lives and to replace them with a more diverse, more secure, lower carbon mix.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The aim is to keep the lights on, and decarbonise on the most cost effective trajectory possible, supporting a diverse mix of low carbon energy.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Keeping the lights on is non-negotiable. Our modern technological society cannot function without power. And a diverse mix provides the most resilient system.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Tackling climate change is also non-negotiable.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The very things that make the British Isles the right place to exploit offshore renewables; makes us vulnerable to climate change too.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Surrounded on all sides by the sea, with an advanced, open, trade-based economy.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The physical manifestations of climate change in the future \u2013 such as increased flooding \u2013 and the economic manifestations \u2013 such as resource shortages, and trade wars \u2013 both will hit us and hit us increasingly hard if we don\u2019t limit climate change.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Going for clean energy isn\u2019t fluffy or indulgent: it makes cold, hard economic sense.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And it makes cold hard business sense: clean energy is a boom market \u2013 bringing jobs and investment and growth.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But it won\u2019t make economic sense if we break the bank doing it \u2013 or lose the support of the public.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That is why it is imperative we control the costs of decarbonisation and limit the impact on people\u2019s bills.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Decarbonisation must be affordable, sensitive to the impact it has on people\u2019s pockets, sensitive to wider economic circumstances, and sensitive to the local communities where infrastructure is built.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We have a long term plan, underpinned by carbon budgets, to meet our responsibilities. It\u2019s all set out in the Climate Change Act.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And this Government is committed to helping see it through.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We have a plan for Electricity Market Reform, set under the last Government, that will help the cost effective decarbonisation of the power sector, attracting the private sector investment we need.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That is of course underpinned by the Levy Control Framework that trebled the support available for low-carbon technology.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That pot is supporting a mixture of low-carbon technologies because both decarbonisation and energy security is best achieved through a diverse energy mix \u2013 not over-reliance on one technology or source.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And the EMR delivery plan sets out what we expect that mix to include by 2020 to meet our objective of generating 30% of electricity from renewables.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We already have enough onshore wind in the pipeline to hit the middle of the range we need for that technology.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Without action we are likely to deploy beyond this range.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We could end up with more onshore wind projects than we can afford, which would lead to either higher bills for consumers, or other renewable technologies, such as offshore wind, losing out on support.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We need to continue investing in less mature technologies so that they realise their promise, just as onshore wind has done.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It is therefore appropriate to curtail further subsidised deployment of onshore wind, balancing the interests of onshore developers with those of bill payers, and developers of other technologies.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So what is the plan for the future deployment of offshore wind?\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "The EMR Delivery plan set out a range of 8-15GW reflecting technology and cost uncertainties at the time of publication.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We expect to see around 10GW by 2020, much more than any country in the world.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And we are achieving real progress towards that.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Just last week we saw the opening of Gwynt-y-Mor, the second largest operating offshore wind farm in the world.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "I know that for the sector to grow, developers and supply chain and investors need as much predictability as possible.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That is why Contracts for Difference were introduced.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The last CfD auction round was a great success for offshore wind with \u2013 East Anglia ONE and Neart na Gaoithe both securing contracts.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "Let us be clear. You and I know there is no bottomless pit of bill payer support for low carbon.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We have a responsibility to keep costs to consumers down.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Because only by keeping costs down will we maintain public support for the action we are taking to bring down carbon emissions and combat climate change.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And that means two things:\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "First, Government support must help technologies eventually stand on their own two feet, not to encourage a permanent reliance on subsidy. Cost must come down, subsidies must be progressively reduced.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Second, the public, and particularly host communities, must see the benefits of the moral and financial support they are providing the industry.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "But these levels of subsidy cannot be sustained indefinitely, particularly if we foresee further deployment in the 2020s.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It is provided now explicitly in order to enable industry to drive down costs, invest and innovate so that offshore wind is well positioned to expand in the 2020s and beyond.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
