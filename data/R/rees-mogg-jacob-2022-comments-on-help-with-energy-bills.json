        "We have seen an unprecedented rise in energy prices following Putin\u2019s illegal war in Ukraine, which has affected consumers up and down the country and businesses of all sizes.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The help we are already putting in place will save families money off their bills, and the government\u2019s plans for businesses, charities and public sector organisations will give them the equivalent level of support.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This, alongside the measures we are taking to boost the amount of domestic energy we produce to improve both energy security and supply, will increase growth, protect jobs and support families with their cost of living this winter.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
