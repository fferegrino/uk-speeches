        "Today\u2019s findings are troubling and unsurprising, and a perfect example of how this government believes it is one rule for them another for the rest of us.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It is appalling that the government not only dismissed these very credible claims of connections influencing this contract as \u2018nonsense\u2019 \u2013 but also that it took a judicial review to bring to light what should be publicly available information on how taxpayer money is being spent.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This government\u2019s contracting has been plagued by cronyism and waste and they must take urgent steps to address this now \u2013 by urgently winding down emergency procurement, releasing details of the VIP fast lane, and publishing all outstanding contracts by the end of the month. This cronyism must stop.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
