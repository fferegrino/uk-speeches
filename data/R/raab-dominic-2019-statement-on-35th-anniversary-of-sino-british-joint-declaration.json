The only way to guarantee Hong Kong\u2019s future success and stability is by respecting these and addressing the legitimate concerns of the people of Hong Kong through meaningful political dialogue.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
