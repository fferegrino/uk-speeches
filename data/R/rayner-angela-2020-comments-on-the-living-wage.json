        "This crisis has shown who we can\u2019t survive without and who is the real backbone of our economy and our society \u2013 our key workers.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It is just plain wrong that three quarters of our care workers do not even earn a living wage, and so many key workers are being paid poverty wages that they can barely survive on.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "When the Tories voted against free school meals they said they wanted to focus on the structural causes of child poverty.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Poverty pay causes child poverty, so if the government actually cares about tackling child poverty then they would act to increase the minimum wage to a level that people can actually live on and support a family on.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Nobody should be working for poverty wages. Every worker should be paid a wage that they can actually live on, and that means a real living wage of at least \u00a310 an hour now.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
