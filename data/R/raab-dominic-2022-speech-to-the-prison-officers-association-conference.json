        "I\u2019m really sorry I can\u2019t be with you all today, but I wanted to record this message for your first in-person conference since the start of the pandemic.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And in particular, I really wanted to take the opportunity to thank all of you, every single one of you, for your incredible hard work, your outstanding dedication during such a tough set of times.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Prison officers, I know, may not always be in the public eye in the same way that police officers, doctors and nurses are. But I\u2019ve got no doubt, and I\u2019ve seen first-hand, that you\u2019re at the front line of our defences when it comes to protecting the public and you do an outstanding, amazing job.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I\u2019d like to see all of you at the front line get more recognition for that incredible work you\u2019ve done, both during the pandemic and more generally.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Throughout COVID-19, you\u2019ve done more than ever to demonstrate why \u2013 in my view at least \u2013 you are the unsung heroes across our justice system.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I\u2019ve been hugely impressed by what I\u2019ve seen in the nine prisons I\u2019ve visited so far since I became Justice Secretary.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "At Category A prisons like HMP Franklin and Woodhill, I saw the extraordinary security challenges that the governors, Darren Finley and Nicola Marfleet, face in dealing with some of the most serious offenders, including radicalised terrorists and dangerous gangsters.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "You guys and your teams, work incredibly hard in what is a very precarious environment, to see the early signs of terrorist risks, to nip them in the bud, to stop the spread of poisonous ideologies, and ultimately help us protect the public.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Of course, in many of those other prisons where the focus is more on rehabilitation, I\u2019ve seen the vital role that governors and staff play in getting prisoners off drugs, getting them skilled up, and getting them into work.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "From the marketing call centre that I saw at HMP High Down, to HMP Ford, where prisoners get the chance to work as HGV drivers when they\u2019re on ROTL. And from HMP Hatfield\u2019s farm shop and the recycling centre, to the working farm and timber processing at HMP Prescoed. From the barbers and bike repair shop at HMP Five Wells, to the mechanics and the cleaning workshop at Wandsworth.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I\u2019ve seen the great potential that we\u2019ve got, and that you\u2019re grasping in prison, to use inmates\u2019 time in a more constructive way, to get them the skills, get them back into work, which is ultimately the way we\u2019ll get them back onto the straight and narrow and reduce reoffending and protect communities around the country.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And, you know, I\u2019m really struck by the conversations that I\u2019ve had with offenders that I\u2019ve met, who are able and willing to take that opportunity to start to turn their lives around.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And I know it\u2019s a long haul, and there\u2019ll be ups and downs for many offenders, but getting prisoners off drugs for good through sustainable recovery, getting them the skills, the training, the work experience they need to go straight, those are two of my very top priorities.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And of course, they\u2019re critical elements in helping those offenders to turn their lives around, and that keeps our streets safer with fewer victims. So the public really do owe you all a debt of gratitude. And I want to say thank you for all that amazing work that you do.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And of course, when I look forward at the agenda that we\u2019ve got ahead of us over the next year, that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to be assessing offenders for any addiction they\u2019ve got from the moment they arrive, so that the treatment plans we put in place, including expanded use of drug recovery wings, a greater focus on abstinence, all of those things can be put in place straight away and strengthen the rehabilitation work you\u2019re doing.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And of course, we\u2019re going to have a zero-tolerance approach to drugs in prisons, clamping down on the illicit items being smuggled in.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We\u2019re enhancing our prison security with a lot of technology that\u2019s been funded by \u00a3100 million of new investment, including the state-of-the-art X-ray scanners across the whole closed male adult estate. I\u2019ve seen them work first-hand and I\u2019m convinced that they will help reduce the violence and help keep prison officers, as well as offenders, safer.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And, of course, we\u2019ll continue to build on our partnership with you at a national level, and between prison governors and local branches of the POA, to create prisons that are better, safer, and which, as I said, through all the work we\u2019re doing, will help drive down reoffending relentlessly.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I now want to pass over to our brilliant Prisons Minister, Victoria Atkins, to take you through some of the detail of our strategy. But again, from the bottom of my heart, through COVID and all the other work that we\u2019re doing, thank you so much for the outstanding job you\u2019re doing, and I look forward to seeing many more of you in the weeks and months ahead.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
