        "Ministers fell over themselves to pose for the cameras and clap our carers earlier this year, but applause doesn\u2019t pay the bills and warm words don\u2019t put food on the table.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It is a moral outrage that three quarters of social care workers do not even earn the real Living Wage. This situation was wrong before this pandemic, but now it is absolutely unconscionable.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "After all that they have done for all of us, a pay rise is the very least that our care worker heroes deserve.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
