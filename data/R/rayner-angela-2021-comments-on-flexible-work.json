        "This is another broken manifesto promise from the Conservatives who promised to make flexible working the default. Once again the Conservatives have sold out working people.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Labour will give workers the right to flexible working \u2013 not just the right to request it. Labour will make flexible working a force for good so that everyone is able to enjoy the benefits of flexible working, from a better work-life balance to less time commuting and more time with their family.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Tory employment law leaves workers waiting up to two years to access some basic rights, including protection against some types of unfair dismissal. Labour will end this arbitrary system and scrap qualifying time for basic rights, such as unfair dismissal, sick pay, and parental leave.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The \u2018new normal\u2019 after this pandemic must mean a new deal for all working people based on flexibility, security and strengthened rights at work.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
