        "Taxpayers deserve to know their money is being handled with great care \u2013 and that any risks of its misuse through tax havens is carefully handled by this government.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Despite evidence from the National Audit Office that taxpayer money was used to pay well over the odds for PPE, and that this government\u2019s procurement process seriously lacks important transparency, we are seeing no real moves to increase clarity or trust.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This government cannot continue to brush worrying patterns like this off. They must commit to cleaning up their contracts now and be far more open to restore public confidence.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
