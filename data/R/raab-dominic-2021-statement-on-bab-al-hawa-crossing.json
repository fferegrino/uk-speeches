        "This is a welcome step, but urgent work must be done by the international community to find a sustainable, long-term solution to deliver aid into northern Syria. The lives of more than 13 million vulnerable Syrians depend on it. The UK will continue to push for a credible political settlement, as the only way to bring an end to the conflict.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
