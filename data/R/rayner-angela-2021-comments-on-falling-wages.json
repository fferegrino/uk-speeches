        "This government has totally failed working people. In-work poverty is at record levels and millions of working people are struggling to make ends meet whilst mates of Ministers and Conservative donors are given billions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Everyone should earn a fair day\u2019s wage for a fair day\u2019s pay and earn enough to raise a family and live a decent, secure and fulfilling life. It is a sign of a broken economic model under the Conservatives that people working full-time or even multiple jobs are not able to make ends meet and millions of children are growing up in poverty in working families.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It\u2019s time to make our economy work for working people. Labour would immediately raise the minimum wage to at least \u00a310 an hour and give workers more power in discussions about pay and benefits by supporting people to negotiate pay rises collectively with all workers in their sector so they can get the fair pay that they deserve.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
