        "It is deeply concerning how much the Government has relied on crony contracts throughout the pandemic, while leaving our frontline workers exposed.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "First the Government acted unlawfully, then the Prime Minister falsely claimed everything had been published.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It is a basic right for the public to know where and how our cash is being spent. The Government needs to come out of hiding, simply publish the contracts it has sitting around and support our frontline staff with PPE not pay cuts.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
