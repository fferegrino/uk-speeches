        "What this plan adds up to is to keep corporation tax where it is today and to take national insurance, which they voted to increase, back to where it was last March.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Some new plan!\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
