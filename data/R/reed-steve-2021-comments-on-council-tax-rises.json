This Government should not be making families pay the price for their broken promises to support councils.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Prime Minister must scrap this economically illiterate council tax rise \u2013 and if he doesn\u2019t, Conservative MPs need to do the right thing and vote with Labour to protect families\u2019 incomes and help secure our economy.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
