        "These reports are extremely distressing. A full investigation must be launched immediately.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "If vulnerable people who call the helpline are not getting the support they need, the programme must be overhauled.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Government rushed to set up the shielding programme as a national scheme instead of integrating it with existing call centres and local support run by councils and charities that know their neighbourhoods better. We need a scheme that\u2019s better integrated with local support to avoid the mistakes the Government is making.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
