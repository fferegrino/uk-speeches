        "It has been a long hard 12 years, that\u2019s seen Tory austerity wreak havoc on our communities.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But \u2013 despite what some would have you believe, being out of Downing Street doesn\u2019t mean we have been out of power.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That would do a gross disservice to Mark in Wales and Labour administrations up and down the country who are making a tangible difference to people\u2019s lives, demonstrating that there is an alternative \u2013 to this bizarre Thatcher tribute act.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Look for instance at the work of our Metro Mayors \u2013 who are using devolution to put Labour values into action.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "Locally they would put rocket boosters on our plans for Hydrogen Production; a mass retrofitting programme for energy inefficient homes and a Mersey Tidal project that would produce enough clean, green predictable energy to power a million homes for over a century.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Or on skills, where Labour would fix the mess the Tories have made of our education and skills system but which would also look to the future.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
