        "Under the Conservatives, families come last. The government\u2019s mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic means Britain is facing one of the worst recessions of any major economy. Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to cut Universal Credit will hit millions of families who are already struggling to get by.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "There cannot be another repeat of the government\u2019s indecision and mismanagement of the free school meals scandal. The government must put families first during this lockdown and act now instead of waiting until the last minute. If ministers refuse, Conservative MPs have to opportunity to vote with Labour and give families the support they need to get through this pandemic.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
