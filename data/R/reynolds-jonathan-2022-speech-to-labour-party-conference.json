        "I believe a fresh start with Labour can rebuild this country.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I\u2019m thinking of the steelworkers I met in Port Talbot who are ready to make the green steel customers want.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The automotive workers in my hometown of Sunderland who have the skills to make the electric cars we need.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The scientists I met at Imperial College who have the ideas to solve some of our greatest challenges.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We\u2019ve got some brilliant people in this country.

        "We don\u2019t have a government who values the collaboration of scientists across Europe.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "There was a time when the Tories believed they were \u2018the party of business\u2019. Now they are just in the business of parties.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "After twelve years of misrule, they have failed British business. On their watch business investment is the lowest in the G7, economic growth is set to be the lowest in the G7. We\u2019ve had the worst squeeze to real wages of any country in the G7.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Don\u2019t just take make my word for it. Ask them. They admit it.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "This is now the big choice in British politics. Everyone agrees the last 12 years have been awful.  \nThe difference is we choose to look to the future while the Conservatives are dusting off the failed policies of the past.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "In the face of an energy crisis, a business investment crisis, a climate crisis who do they pick to meet these challenges? Jacob Rees-Mogg!\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "One newspaper said he was better suited to running a museum than the business department. Frankly, museums are far too important for that.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Now the Tories want to claim they\u2019ve got the answer to the problems they created \u2013 higher bankers bonuses, cuts to corporation tax, \u2018deregulation\u2019, picking fights and divisive politics. It won\u2019t work.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "George Osbourne\u2019s cuts to corporation tax didn\u2019t increase business investment and we all know what \u2018deregulation\u2019 is code for. Cuts to working people\u2019s rights, cuts to environmental standards so more sewage ends up in our rivers and a race to the bottom which good businesses and working people never win.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Now I agree with the Tories on one thing \u2013 the last 12 years have been a disaster.

        "Finally we will value the care sector for what it is \u2013 an essential part of our economy, ending the job insecurity too often associated with this vital work.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Policies like fair pay agreements will be to the next Labour government what the National Minimum Wage was to the last one.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

These provide the real alternative the country needs.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Labour knows that is how you grow the economy. Not on the backs of working people or rewarding bad practice. But through vision, leadership and real partnership to make economic success a reality.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "No-one can deny Britain faces significant challenges. But rather than shrink from these challenges, the role of government is to meet them head on.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Many of you lived through the 80s when Tory Governments left people on their own in the face of massive industrial change.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We cannot \u2013 and we must not \u2013 allow this generation of Tories to do the same in response to the challenges we face today.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
