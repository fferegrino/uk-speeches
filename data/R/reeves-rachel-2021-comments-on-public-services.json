        "This Government has eroded not only our public services to the brink of collapse, but so much of what it means to be an honourable and transparent government.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "While this Tory Government has denied key workers in our public services a pay rise, they paid 900 management consultants at Deloitte \u00a31,000 a day to work on test and trace.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The beating heart of our country is the key workers who have kept us going through this last year. That\u2019s why we applauded them. Children weren\u2019t banging pots and pans for management consultants. They were clapping our key workers.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The public is also paying a high price for this Government\u2019s mismanagement and waste. This current Tory Party is rife with conflicts of interest. It\u2019s all cheques and no balances.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "People expect all of us seeking government to spend their money with care and respect \u2013 and a Labour government will.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Labour will clean up government contracting by strengthening FOI, introducing a new Independent Anti-Corruption Commissioner, and an Integrity and Ethics Commission to make us a world leader in good governance and transparency.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
