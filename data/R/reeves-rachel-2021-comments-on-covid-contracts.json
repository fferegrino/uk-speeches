        "The scale of corruption risk to vast amounts of taxpayer money revealed in this report is shocking, as is the evidence of endemic cronyism flowing through the government\u2019s contracting.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Standards on public contracts have slipped so far under this Conservative government that this would be embarrassing if it wasn\u2019t so serious.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Labour have consistently asked for the government to get the basics right \u2013 calling on them to publish the names of businesses that won lucrative Covid contracts through the \u2018VIP fast lane\u2019, ramp up transparency and come clean to taxpayers about the \u00a32 billion worth of contracts that have gone to Tory friends and donors.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Instead they\u2019ve let cronyism and sleaze run through the core of their procurement and contracting.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
