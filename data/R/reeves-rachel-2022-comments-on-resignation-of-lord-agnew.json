        "This is a damning indictment of the Chancellor and the Government\u2019s failures on fraud.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That the Government\u2019s own anti-fraud minister feels he is unable to defend the Government\u2019s record on billions of pounds of taxpayer cash gifted to criminals tells you all you need to know about the incompetence of this government.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It should be a source of enduring shame to the Chancellor that he has so casually written off \u00a34.3bn of taxpayers\u2019 money that is now in the hand of criminals and gangs.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Coming on top of billions spent on crony contracts and billions more lost in loan fraud schemes, these levels of waste destroy any claim the Conservatives have to careful stewardship of the public finances.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Labour would treat every pound of taxpayer money with the respect it deserves.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
