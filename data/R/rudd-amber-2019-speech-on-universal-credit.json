        "**Introduction**\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It\u2019s great be here in Kennington this morning.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I\u2019m particularly pleased to be joined by frontline colleagues and work coaches in the audience today and I\u2019d like to acknowledge the incredible work you do, each and every day, to ensure our claimants receive the payments and support they need. I\u2019d also like to welcome Alok Sharma, the Minister for Employment who I\u2019m pleased could join me here today.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And I am delighted to be here to speak about Universal Credit \u2013 a vital reform delivering a fair and compassionate welfare system, which helps people into work.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Let\u2019s not forget that Universal Credit began with near universal support \u2013 across party lines, and from charities and stakeholders.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Because everyone agrees with the principles of helping people into work, making work pay, and providing support in times of need.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And I want Universal Credit to retain that support as we deliver it in practice.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This means delivering it in a way that meets the needs of claimants, who come from every conceivable background and each with the potential to achieve their ambitions.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "In welfare, there is no one-size-fits-all solution, and Universal Credit offers the opportunity to move away from that.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It must treat individuals as individuals \u2013 and I will set-out the first steps I will take to achieve this today.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "**The principle of UC and why it matters**\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Our welfare system is based upon 3 fundamental principles.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "First: work \u2013 those who can, should; and those who cannot should be protected from poverty.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Second \u2013 work should always pay.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And third, the system should be fair. Fair for taxpayers who pay for it and fair to those who receive it, and fair to future generations \u2013 who do not deserve to become trapped in it.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "As a nation, I believe we all want a decent safety net: if you\u2019re facing a difficult moment in life, the state should be there to help you.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Whether that\u2019s becoming unemployed, falling ill, or facing bereavement \u2013 nobody should find themselves alone in desperate circumstances.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But it is vital that people are supported by this safety net, not trapped beneath it.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It is there to help people get through difficult times \u2013 it is not meant to be a mode of long term subsistence for those who can work.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "For the vast majority of people, it is ultimately work, not benefits, which provides the route to a better life. And the welfare system should clear a path for that route, not block it.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Work gives purpose, dignity and security. The opportunity to provide for your family, progress in earnings, and build a fulfilling life.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "In this respect, the old system was broken; it is why we had to reform it.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Despite what some people suggest, the legacy system \u2013 6 different benefits administered by 3 government departments \u2013 was not a utopia that we should return to.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Indeed, 700,000 claimants on that system are currently failing to claim their full entitlement because they find it so confusing. These people \u2013 some of the most vulnerable in society \u2013 are failing to receive, on average, \u00a3285 a month.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Under the old regime, claimants who moved off benefits into full time work lost welfare payments almost immediately, which resulted in effective \u2018tax rates\u2019 of up to 90% on their income.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "As an MP, I frequently met people who wanted to earn more but were too scared to take-on extra hours, knowing they\u2019d have so little to gain.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "In 2010, 1.4 million people in this country had been out of work for at least 9 of the previous 10 years.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "1.9 million children lived in households where nobody worked, making it more likely that tragically, they too would live a life on welfare \u2013 with little chance of any kind of progression.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We have re-introduced fairness into the system.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We have capped benefits \u2013 so that where the adults in a household are able to work, they cannot claim more than what many working families earn.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We have taken millions of the lowest-paid out of income tax altogether.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And we\u2019ve introduced the first National Living Wage, giving many a much-needed pay rise.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But by far the most important and crucial reform is Universal Credit.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Let me explain why Universal Credit is a force for good. It is based on these principles:\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "a social security system that provides a safety net, but doesn\u2019t trap people in welfare  \ncertainty that every extra hour of work pays more than staying on benefits, with these being withdrawn at a consistent taper rate  \nhelp to enter work \u2013 through increased, tailored support provided by work coaches at jobcentres like this one  \naccuracy of benefits payments, with those made to in-work claimants responding in real-time, each month, to income earned. A digital system \u2013 where claimants can access information about their payments online, at their convenience\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "These principles pumped much-needed fresh air into a failing system, and failed thinking on welfare.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Which is why it is vital that we turn these principles into success in practice. We have steadily invested in Universal Credit, adding \u00a34.5 billion in the last budget, following the extra \u00a31.5 billion allocated in 2017 \u2013 giving claimants more money as they transition to Universal Credit.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And in many areas we are succeeding. More people will enter work as a result of Universal Credit and work coach support.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The provision of Universal Support \u2013 to provide tailored help for people to make and complete their Universal Credit claim \u2013 is a significant new step in creating personalised support for claimants.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And it\u2019s very exciting that from April this year, Citizens Advice will be working to deliver this new support across the country.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But in other areas we can improve \u2013 in particular, we must ensure that Universal Credit always meets the different needs of different claimants.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And today, I will outline 3:\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "First \u2013 the delivery of the next phase of Universal Credit, known as managed migration, must be handled carefully so it works for all claimants.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Second \u2013 flexibility in payments, especially on rent and frequency, should support people financially in a way that works for them.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And third \u2013 the system must do even more to support women.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "A standard offer cannot work for everyone. People\u2019s work patterns, the pressures they face, their families \u2013 everyone\u2019s circumstances are unique.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I want to make sure Universal Credit has enough flexibility to adapt to personal circumstances \u2013 particularly the needs of the most vulnerable.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So let me set-out in detail the changes that I\u2019m going to make.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "**Delivering UC in a way that works for individuals**\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "In the first instance, I am not going to be rushed into the mass migration of existing claimants onto Universal Credit. My priority is to ensure that the transition is done well.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "As we embark on this next stage, I want to be absolutely sure that every person switched over to Universal Credit is getting a personalised service.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I will tread cautiously \u2013 not rushing but instead proceeding with the utmost care.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I want to ensure every individual is thoroughly supported to access Universal Credit quickly and successfully.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We need to reach out to claimants \u2013 so the onus should be on us to deliver managed migration in a way that meets everyone\u2019s needs.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So I am going to change the current regulations, removing the powers government previously planned to migrate all legacy claimants onto the new system. The regulations will continue to uphold our commitment to protecting claimants receiving the Severe Disability Premium.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Instead, I\u2019m only going to seek powers for a pilot: the chance to support 10,000 people through the process. This is an opportunity to learn how we can best facilitate the transition \u2013 before returning to Parliament with the legislation which we will need for future managed migration.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This will begin, as planned, from July 2019.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "These next 6 months will be a period of careful preparation, working closely with claimants and partners \u2013 many of them who are in the room today \u2013 to design our communications and support systems effectively.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We want to ensure the process goes smoothly for claimants, so we will provide tailored communications, help with applications, and even home visits \u2013 with bespoke support for the most vulnerable claimants.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "From July, we will carefully migrate up to 10,000 claimants, monitoring and adjusting our approach as needs be, before reporting our findings to Parliament.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The lessons from the pilot will inform our next steps, but there will be no overall delay.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Universal Credit migration will be completed, as planned, by the end of 2023. However, I will consider carefully the results of the pilot, and its implications for scaling-up migration.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It would not be sensible to move immediately from the pilot phase of 10,000, to full scale managed migration.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Instead we should start small and build up over time, as we develop our processes and learn more. This is the approach any big organisation would take when delivering a complex project.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I want to be clear: I will only proceed with this process when I know it can deliver the best possible service for everyone who relies on it.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "**Alternative Payment Arrangements**\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But equally, I don\u2019t need to wait for the results of the pilot to see there are issues with Universal Credit\u2019s implementation which can be fixed now.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Much of the premise of UC, and the positive change it offers, is based on the fact that it mirrors the world of work. Payments are made monthly, in arrears, and all the money goes straight to claimants.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "For many people this is an advantage \u2013 providing financial independence and preparation for monthly bills and salary payments.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But for others this approach does not work; managing their money month-to-month can be challenging, even impossible.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That can cause difficulties for people who are already vulnerable, and I am determined to do more to help those claimants.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "There is already some flexibility in the system, thanks to the changes that we have already made.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Around 60% of Universal Credit claimants apply for advances to tide them over the initial wait for their first payment.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "20% of claimants with housing costs have their rent paid directly to landlords, because a vulnerability or special need has been identified.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And for people unable to budget, there are provisions to receive payments twice, or even four times, a month. But currently only 2% of claimants have taken this option.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So although these \u2018Alternative Payment Arrangements\u2019 exist to provide people with the bespoke payments they need, they aren\u2019t yet helping as many claimants as I believe they could.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "One third of UC claimants in social rented housing have their rent paid directly to their landlord. But in the private sector, that number is only 5%.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "People in the private rented sector already face a far higher risk of losing their tenancy, and I know from talking to claimants and landlords that the current system isn\u2019t working for some of them.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So we need to make it easier for tenants in the private sector to find and keep a good home, by giving landlords greater certainty that their rent will be paid.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Therefore, I have asked the Department to build an online system for private landlords, so they can request (where necessary) for their tenant\u2019s rent to be paid directly to them. And I will consider what else we can do, because I am determined to help keep people in their homes.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I am also looking at what more can be done to support those who find monthly payments hard to manage.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We need to go back to first principles: reviewing how we identify claimants who might struggle to manage on monthly payments, and ensuring work coaches are moving them onto more frequent payments where necessary.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I have asked Jobcentre Plus to test how we can to improve the provision of more frequent payments for new claimants; these pilots will start shortly, and once we have evidence of what works, we will roll it out further.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We must ensure that provision of frequent payments doesn\u2019t slow the system for users who don\u2019t require them \u2013 but I believe we can offer this facility more widely, so those in genuine need can take it up more readily.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "**Women\u2019s economic empowerment**\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Indeed, some of the most exciting results we\u2019ve seen from Universal Credit have resulted from personalised and targeted support reaching the right people.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This is particularly true for groups who have historically been left out of the labour market.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Women can never be truly free until they have economic independence.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It is fantastic that 1.6 million women have entered employment since 2010 but for some women, economic empowerment remains the final frontier.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Many women still don\u2019t have access to the opportunities and independence that comes from earning their own money.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This can be particularly true of communities that hold a more traditional view of gender specific roles.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Under the old system, millions of women could be written off as \u201cdependents\u201d and left without any encouragement or support from the system. Under Universal Credit that won\u2019t happen.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "For example, last week I visited our Jobcentre in Birmingham Yardley \u2013 which has piloted a brilliant project focusing specifically on how to support Bangladeshi and Pakistani women into work.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It is early days, but projects like these suggest there are ways to free untapped female potential. And in doing so, we\u2019ll benefit communities across the country, and inspire the next generation to understand the value of financial independence.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Since taking office, I have also listened to a number of concerns \u2013 from Refuge, Women\u2019s Aid and others \u2013 about how the current structure of household payments penalises women.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Although one payment per household is an established feature of the welfare system (Housing Benefit, for example, has always been paid in this way) I recognise the validity of these concerns.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This is why I am committed to ensuring that household payments go directly to the main carer \u2013 which is usually, but not always, the woman.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "For those couples currently claiming UC, around 60% of payments already go to the woman\u2019s bank account. However, I am looking at what more we can do to enable the main carer to receive the UC payment, and we will begin to make those changes later this year.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Childcare is essential to enable parents to work. Although UC\u2019s provision of funding up to 85% of a claimant\u2019s childcare costs is higher than its predecessor, this is paid in arrears only once actual costs are known.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So I recognise that this can cause financial difficulty, with some claimants struggling to pay upfront or report their costs on time.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Therefore I\u2019ve instructed jobcentres that if the initial month\u2019s childcare costs prevent a claimant from starting work, the Flexible Support Fund should be used to help smooth the transition for this priority group.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Secondly, I\u2019ve decided we should be flexible when parents are unable to report their childcare costs immediately, so that these costs will be reimbursed.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Taken together, these improvements will help to drive the take-up of childcare, as we strive to close the lone parent employment gap and further boost female employment rates.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I believe passionately that economic independence liberates women, and I will continue to look at what more Universal Credit can do to support them into work.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "I think it is fair that those on welfare are asked to make the same considered decision as other taxpayers, who support themselves solely through work. So I believe it was right to limit the number of children for whom support can be provided through Universal Credit \u2013 funded by the taxpayer.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "However, I believe it is unfair to apply that limit retrospectively.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "As it stands, from February the two-child limit will be applied to families applying for UC who had their children before the cap was even announced. That is not right.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So I can today announce that I am going to scrap the extension of the two-child limit on Universal Credit for children born before April 2017.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
