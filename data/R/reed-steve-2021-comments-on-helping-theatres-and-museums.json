        "Theatres, galleries, cinemas and museums are the cultural heartbeat of our town centres but they are under threat as never before because of this Government\u2019s incompetence and economic mismanagement.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Chancellor\u2019s dither and delay has created uncertainty for businesses, cost jobs and threatened our recovery, despite Labour\u2019s repeated calls to provide businesses with breathing space by extending the business rate holiday and the VAT cut for hospitality and leisure.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Britain can\u2019t afford the Chancellor to make the same irresponsible mistake all over again. He must give businesses certainty and reduce the risk of losing both jobs and life-enhancing cultural institutions.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
