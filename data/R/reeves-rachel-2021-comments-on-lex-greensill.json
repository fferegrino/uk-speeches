        "The allegation that billions of pounds of taxpayer and NHS cash was put at the mercy of Lex Greensill without so much as a contract signed is shocking, and Conservative cronyism down to a tee.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We need Cameron to come out of hiding and apologise, but we also need answers.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Conservatives must make it clear how \u2013 after 10-years of weakening the bodies meant to investigate cronyism and corruption \u2013 they are going to tackle this growing problem.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "With thousands of British jobs on the line after the collapse of Greensill, they must stop ignoring scandals piling up on their watch and take action to clean up the waste and cronyism becoming their hallmark.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
