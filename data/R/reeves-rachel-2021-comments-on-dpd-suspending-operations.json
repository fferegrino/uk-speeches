        "This government said it was prepared for a smooth transition \u2013 but instead major carriers like DPD are left wrangling with completely overwhelmed systems without any help.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "As well as consumers, this impacts on British companies large to small \u2013 from carriers like DPD to the many small, independent businesses already under such huge strain trying to sell across Europe.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This government seems to prefer throwing taxpayer money at expensive consultants over listening to experienced businesses and offering them the practical, common sense support they need \u2013 like a helpline that functions when they\u2019re operating.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This government can talk the talk, but clearly can\u2019t walk the walk when it comes to supporting British businesses.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
