        "There are serious questions that Baroness Mone must answer about whether she was telling the truth when she said that she played no role in the awarding of \u00a3200m of taxpayers\u2019 money to PPE Medpro. Boris Johnson and the Conservative party also have serious questions to answer about Baroness Mone\u2019s position if she is found to have lied about her role in these contracts and the VIP fast-track lane.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "If Baroness Mone wasn\u2019t telling the truth about her role in these contracts, then she has clearly failed to uphold the Nolan principles and there are further questions to answer about whether she has breached the House of Lords code of conduct. Baroness Mone should refer herself to the House of Lords commissioners for investigation if she is confident she has done nothing wrong and has nothing to hide.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
