        "It\u2019s encouraging to see these first moves towards a global pact on tax avoidance.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But this government has spent the last few weeks actively watering down what was initially intended to be an ambitious 21% rate of global minimum corporate tax.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That would have brought \u00a3131 million extra a week to Britain for our NHS and other public services, while also stopping our high streets being aggressively undercut.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This government must now show leadership, push for a 21% rate in negotiations, and use the money to fund our schools and our NHS.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
