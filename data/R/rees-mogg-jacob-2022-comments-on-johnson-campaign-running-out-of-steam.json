        "On the way back from Coventry, the news that Liz Truss was resigning came through. Liz is an admirable person and I supported what she wanted to do. Unfortunately, it did not work. The moment she went, the telephone started buzzing with potential candidates and slates. I wanted Boris back, as he had the mandate and his removal was a mistake. His campaign started well but then ran out of steam. This was clear by Sunday morning, when my slumbers were disturbed by the great man himself prior to the Laura Kuenssberg programme. Unlike the famous farmer, the lark is not my morning alarmer, so I was not entirely gruntled by so early a call.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
