        "Fellow delegates, every time in recent years that I have stood here and looked out at Conference- and it is great to be doing so once again \u2013 I remember the first ever SNP Conference I attended.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It was in Rothesay in 1983, which means \u2013 amazingly \u2013 that it is almost 40 years ago. I don\u2019t remember much about what was discussed.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But I do remember that the hall \u2013 that great wide hall in the wonderful Rothesay Pavilion that sits alas now only half restored and completely out of use \u2013 could be swallowed up in here several times over.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "At that time, of course, there was no Scottish Parliament. And in the Westminster the General Election just three months before we had taken only 2 seats. Labour won 41 the Tories 21 , and even the Liberals got 8. We got 2 on 11 % of the vote .\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Moreover support for Independence \u2013 when it was even measured in the polls, which was rarely if ever \u2013 was actually less than that.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Fellow delegates if ever I get a little disheartened by the constant negativity of our opponents .\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "If ever I get a bit frustrated by some people who claim to be travelling our road, but seem determined only to put obstacles on it.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I think of that conference in Rothesay and I reflect on how far we have come since then.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Once in a while that is the right thing to do.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Forty years on, in the fact of an ever increasing unionist onslaught, driven by fear not of us, but of the people of Scotland , we need sometimes to take stock.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Not to pat ourselves in the back but to give us the energy and the determination to finish the job that those who came before us were determined to see done.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "To be a spur and an inspiration to us, helping us to finish the job. Because although this party has achieved much, it still has much to achieve. And if we don\u2019t knuckle down that challenge, then nobody will.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Fellow delegates unlike in 1983, the tools for that job are to hand. Today. Here. Ready to be used.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Angus has already talked about the papers that the Scottish Government \u2013 an SNP Scottish Government \u2013 is producing that give us the arguments we need about the key issues.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Admittedly our opponents are doing that too \u2013 proving to us and the wider world how morally, politically , intellectually and constitutional bankrupt they now are and how there is nothing \u201cgreat\u201d left in \u201cgreat Britain\u201d.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Our choice is stark and clear \u2013 decline with the UK, or prosper as a normal, small, independent country within the EU.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We know when the choice will made too. If the Supreme Court rules in our favour, it will be on the 19th of October next year.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And it the Supreme Court fails the people of Scotland then we will rise to that challenge too and put our case in the next general election, whenever that is.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The choice that has to be made if Scotland is to escape from the downward spiral of Tory and Labour government exploiting but ignoring Scotland.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And we know what will motivate the people of Scotland when they come to choose.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "In August an Ipsos Mori poll identified the key issues for us. The argument that says that \u201cPeople in Scotland want to take the country in a very different political direction to England\u201d \u2013 our argument on the doorsteps day in and day out \u2013 was voted by almost 60% of people as being \u2018very\u2019 or \u2018fairly\u2019 convincing.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "58% of our fellow voters thought that \u201cScotland should be independent because Westminster governments cannot be trusted to act in Scotland\u2019s interests\u201d Our argument every day of the year, and every year I have been in this party.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And 53% agreed that \u201cScotland should be independent because the UK left the European Union even though Scotland voted to Remain\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "An argument I make time and again, fuelled by the experience of fighting against Brexit in Whitehall for five long years.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And the poll even told us where we still had work to do \u2013 for example to convince our fellow Scots that our economy will be stronger outside the UK than within it and that jobs would be secure \u2013 though even in August opinions was almost tied on the economy and that was before Kwasi Kwarteng tanked the pound.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But best of all fellow delegates we have an unbeatable advantage.The advantage you can see if you just look around you now.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "There is across Scotland a strong YES movement which seeks, in the words of the first American Vice President John Adams to \u201cbegin government anew from the foundations and build it as we choose\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "A movement of ordinary men and women, drawn from this country and across the globe who want a better country to live in, a fairer, more equitable, kinder and more generous society and who know that choosing independence is the only way to get it.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I will say a bit more this afternoon about how we should work with that movement, in mutual respect and with the highest standards of campaigning.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But let me say a word or two what we should do \u2013 we, the SNP, the vehicle for Scottish Independence\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
