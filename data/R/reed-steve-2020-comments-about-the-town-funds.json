        "Scandal-prone Robert Jenrick has, yet again, been dragged to the House of Commons to explain why he misused taxpayers\u2019 money to benefit the Conservative Party.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "Sunlight is the best disinfectant: Mr Jenrick must answer these questions and reassure the public that taxpayers\u2019 cash isn\u2019t being misused by the Conservatives for their own gain.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
