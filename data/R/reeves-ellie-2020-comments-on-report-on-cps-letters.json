        "Communication with survivors of rape and domestic abuse is essential to maintain confidence in the criminal justice system. But this report shows a stark deterioration and a lack of Government action over the last two years.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The fact that so few case letters are of the right quality, and so many are lacking in empathy, is a stark reminder that the Conservatives are letting down victims.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The CPS must urgently review whether it is delivering on its commitments to ensure victims have faith that the criminal justice system will be there for them.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
