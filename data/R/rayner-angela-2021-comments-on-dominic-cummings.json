        "The questions raised today go to the heart of the Prime Minister\u2019s direct and personal responsibility for the UK\u2019s shocking death toll.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Boris Johnson\u2019s casual disregard for the safety of the British people has had fatal consequences. From care homes to borders, repeatedly locking down too late and failing to learn from his mistakes, the Prime Minister\u2019s decisions and failures resulted in tens of thousands of avoidable deaths.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Families who lost loved ones deserve to know the truth. The public inquiry cannot possibly be delayed any further. No more dither, no more delay. No more blustering his way through. Over 127,000 grieving families deserve answers.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
