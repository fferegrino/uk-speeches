        "It says everything about the rampant Tory sleaze consuming this government that such a huge conflict of interest was revealed by mistake.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Government keeps saying that it wants to be transparent on deals \u2013 but the redactions on this contract show this was a deliberate cover up. They\u2019ve been caught red handed.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It\u2019s clear it\u2019s one rule for the Conservative Party and their friends and donors, and another for everyone else.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
