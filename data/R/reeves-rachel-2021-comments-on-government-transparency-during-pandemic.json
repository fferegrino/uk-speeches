        "This underlines the absolutely crucial need for this government to be far more transparent and honest, something Labour has consistently called for.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Open and accountable governments make better governments, but Johnson\u2019s administration has not only acted unlawfully in this regard, but also seems willing too often to bend the truth.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "With growing stories of taxpayer waste and cronyism, they should take the lessons from today\u2019s report and immediately ramp up transparency to reassure the British people that they are using their money responsibly in the fight against Covid.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
