        "This leaked letter lifts the lid on a growing sense of chaos and confusion between Cabinet Ministers at the Government\u2019s complacent approach to vital preparations ahead of 31 December.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "There is growing alarm from the business communities in Northern Ireland and increasingly in Britain that Ministers aren\u2019t being entirely open about the state of preparations.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "These issues will affect countless businesses and jobs and are simply far too important to be left to written correspondence like this. This extraordinary letter deserves answers, not just given to the House of Commons, but to the industries and people who stand to be affected if the Government gets this badly wrong.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
