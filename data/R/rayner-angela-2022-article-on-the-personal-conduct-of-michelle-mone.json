        "We learn that PPE Medpro was given \u00a3203m to supply face masks and sterile surgical gowns at the height of the pandemic. Lady Mone, a Tory peer, referred PPE MedPro to the Cabinet Office in May 2020, five days before it was even registered as a company. She contacted the then ministers Michael Gove and fellow Conservative peer Lord Agnew, offering to supply PPE \u2013 for a price. Lord Agnew referred PPE Medpro to the \u201cVIP lane\u201d, fast-tracking the bid for public contracts.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
