        "Michael Gove has contradicted himself so many times it\u2019s no surprise he won\u2019t answer questions about his role in his friends being unlawfully awarded more than half a million pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Gove\u2019s attitude smacks of a contempt for the truth and habitual dishonesty. If he is so sure he\u2019s done nothing wrong he should publish all the correspondence and refer himself for an investigation so he can clear his name.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "After the Matt Hancock scandal the stench of sleaze hanging around this government is growing stronger every day. The public need answers about what has gone on here, and there is clear evidence that Michael Gove has broken the Ministerial Code.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
