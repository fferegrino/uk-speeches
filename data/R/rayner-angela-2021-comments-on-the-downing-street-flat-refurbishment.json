        "The Conservatives think it\u2019s one rule for them and another for everyone else. Throughout this pandemic, the Government has shown utter disregard for taxpayers\u2019 money, using the public purse as a personal cashpoint.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It\u2019s staggering that the Prime Minister could rack up a \u00a3200,000 bill for a luxury refurbishment yet have no knowledge of how it was eventually paid. And with the charge sheet against the Health Secretary getting longer and longer, Boris Johnson needs to explain why the public should trust him to lead such a major government department.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Government has at long last admitted that a Tory donor has been funding the Prime Minister\u2019s private life. We know this isn\u2019t the only aspect of the Prime Minister\u2019s lifestyle that may be being funded by Tory donors \u2013 No 10 must now come clean about how far this goes.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Any government documents relating to Lord Brownlow should be published to prove that no conflict of interest exists.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
