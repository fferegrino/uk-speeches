        "The funding that councils have received is nowhere near enough to cover the cost of getting communities through this crisis. Now councils face a massive financial black hole that will hit poorer areas hardest.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "By law councils will be forced to make devastating in-year cuts that will see frail older people denied care, libraries and leisure centres shut for good and bins left unemptied.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Conservatives have broken their promise to fund councils to do whatever\u2019s necessary. Instead of levelling up they are leaving communities without the funding they need to get through the pandemic at their time of greatest need. They should stand by their promises.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
