        "These explosive new revelations show clear discrepancies between what the Secretary of State told the House of Commons and what appears in the official documents.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The documents clearly show that Mr Jenrick did not notify officials immediately after his meeting with Mr Desmond; rather than \u201cclosing down\u201d the discussion as he claims, he initiated contact with Mr Desmond by text message the following day; and it confirms that he rushed through the decision specifically to help the developer avoid a \u00a330-50m levy payable to the local council for infrastructure in one of the poorest local authorities in England.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Housing Secretary needs to come to the House to explain these discrepancies as a matter of urgency: the public must be reassured that there is not one rule for the Conservatives and their wealthy donors and another rule for everyone else.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
