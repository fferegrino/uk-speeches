        "This week is a chance for the Government to back British business and help our public services rebuild out of the pandemic.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Boris Johnson is gifting the biggest multinationals \u00a3131 million a week. Labour says let\u2019s fund our NHS instead.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Now that we\u2019re out of the EU we have even more reason to show global leadership in cracking down on tax avoidance.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Yet this government seems set on weakening a deal that would bring billions back to Britain and stop our high streets being undercut by the likes of Amazon, Google and other big multinationals.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "If the Government is serious about seeing our high streets thrive, they must make sure the businesses on them \u2013 whether it\u2019s on Armley Town Street in my constituency, or Market Square in the Chancellor\u2019s \u2013 have a level playing field.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
