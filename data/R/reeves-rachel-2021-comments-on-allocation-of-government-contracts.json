        "These revelations are explosive. It is shocking that basic checks were missed and companies without proper certification were allowed to jump the queue.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Time and time again Labour has called on the Conservatives to publish details of companies on the VIP fast lane, and time and time again they have refused, and insisted on covering them up.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "If the Conservatives don\u2019t publish all of the details now, it is further proof that they think it is one rule for them and another for everyone else.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
