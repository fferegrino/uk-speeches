        "Hello and thank you very much for inviting me to this excellent event hosted by the CHPA and the Energy Institute.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "There are 3 key points I would like to make in my speech today:\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Firstly, our genuine commitment to renewable heat and CHP as part of the UK\u2019s competitive, low carbon energy mix.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Secondly, an update on our progress we have made so far on delivering the heat programme and Renewable Heat Incentive.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Thirdly, the need to go even further and raise the level of our ambition, placing the renewable heat sector at the centre of the UK\u2019s drive towards green growth.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "To begin with, I wanted to set a little bit of political context.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Since day one of coming into government, we have known that for millions of hardworking people the daily cost of living is one of the greatest worries that they face.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And I don\u2019t need to tell you that right now delivering a better deal for energy consumers is our highest priority.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "While it is right that we are looking at how to reduce the cost of energy on consumer bills\u2026\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "\u2026.we all know that the best way to bring down prices is to help people to save energy, ensure fair tariffs and encourage competition.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "That is exactly what this Government is doing.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "We are working to deliver the Prime Minister\u2019s pledge to ensure that consumers are on the cheapest tariff to suit their needs.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "We are backing reforms to make sure that more electricity trading takes place on the open market.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "We are putting in place an annual review of the state of competition in the electricity market.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And we are providing bankable certainty for new investors through our energy market reforms which are set to unlock \u00a3110 billion of low carbon investment.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "To complement EMR, we also we need an explosion in consumer choice\u2026\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "\u2026and I have spoken in the past of my vision of an energy sector of the big 60,000 that rise to challenge the Big 6 energy companies.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "A vision where companies, communities, public sector and third sector organisations grab the opportunity to generate their own energy\u2026\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "\u2026and start to export their excess on a competitive, commercial basis.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "This is an ambition that happily unites the drive to get a better deal for hard pressed consumers with ambitions for a greener, more local energy sector.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "I want to see CHP and renewable heat at the heart of this.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "But to do this we also need to do even more to cut red tape and eradicate any remaining over complicated or overlapping government policy that stands in the way.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "We also need a long-term approach and some of the big questions that we are looking at today give a great sense of the scope of the issue including:\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "What role there will be for house-by-house solutions like heat pumps, for local solutions like heat networks, or for national solutions involving low carbon gas in the existing grid?\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "How quickly does the transformation need to happen?\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "What does this means for customers and who will pay for it?\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "These are not all questions that we can answer today \u2013 although I am sure lots of you will have opinions and judging by the stellar list of speakers, I am sure lots of constructive discussion will take place.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Make no mistake, I am clear that we need to get on with delivering what we can deliver now.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "But we must extend our horizon beyond the here and now and plan for the longer term.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And that is exactly what we have been doing in Government.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Planning \u2013 not procrastinating!\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
