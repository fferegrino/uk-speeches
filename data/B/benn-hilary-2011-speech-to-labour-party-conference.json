        "Good morning Conference. Can I begin by thanking my team Helen Jones and Paul Blomfield \u2013 Paul it\u2019s great to see you back fit and well \u2013 and all our MPs for the work they do taking the fight to the Government in the House of Commons.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Ed\u2019s great speech on Tuesday reminded us that politics \u2013 like life \u2013 is about the choices we make. It\u2019s about the values we uphold. And nothing matters more right now than the economy.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Where we got it wrong \u2013 like on bank regulation \u2013 we\u2019ve held our hands up. But everyone else got it wrong too. George Osborne used to complain not that we weren\u2019t doing enough on the banks but that we were being too tough on them. He was wrong then and we\u2019ll take no lectures from him.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And he was wrong again when those frightened people were queuing up outside the branches of Northern Rock to ask for all their money back. Now when that happens \u2013 your banking system is on the point of collapse.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And the real test of politics is not what you do when times are easy but the choices you make when times are tough. And we made the right choice. I rang my father up that day and said \u201cDad, you know you always told me that we should nationalise the banks. Well I\u2019ve got some news for you\u201d\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And why did we do it ? Because we made a choice to protect people\u2019s savings, to protect people\u2019s jobs and to protect people\u2019s homes, and for that we should never apologise.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And it\u2019s exactly the same choice we face today when a new crisis threatens. Do you act or do you stand on one side. And whose side on you on?\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Every day in the House of Commons we face a Tory Government kept in office by the votes of the Liberal Democrats and Nick Clegg.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "They\u2019re not a happy bunch.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Tim Farron wants out, and Chris Huhne is after his boss\u2019s job. He thinks Nick Clegg should go off to be an EU Commissioner \u2013 indeed he\u2019s so keen on the idea that he\u2019s offered to drive him to Brussels himself.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And why are they unhappy? Well we know why.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Cancelling the loan to Forgemasters, not backing Bombardier in Derby where British skill and British engineering has been building trains for 170 years, and tuition fees. Nick Clegg made a promise. He broke it. And that\u2019s why people will never trust the Lib Dems again.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Now, beating the Lib Dems is pleasure \u2013 and we should thank them for the help they\u2019re giving us \u2013 but Conference beating the Tories is business.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Look at what they\u2019re doing to the economy. Growth is flatlining. Unemployment is rising. And that\u2019s going to make it harder to pay off the deficit.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Look at their broken promises.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "David Cameron promised to protect Sure Start. But Sure Start centres are closing.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "He promised that ministers who came up with cuts to the front line would be sent packing, but instead it\u2019s 16,000 police officers who are going.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "He promised no top down reorganisation of the NHS, but now he\u2019s wasting billions on doing just that.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And he actually wants to be able to fine your local NHS hospital up to 10% of its turnover for something called anti-competitive behaviour even though he can\u2019t explain what that means.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "That\u2019s the Tories for you. They actually do think that our hospitals are no different from banks or phone companies. Well we know they are different and that\u2019s why the British people will never trust the Tories on the NHS again.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "This is a government that\u2019s got rid of EMAs and the Future Jobs Fund at a time when one in five young people can\u2019t find a job.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "We have a No 10 adviser who wants to get rid of maternity leave.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "A schools Secretary who seems only to be interested in the education of some of our children, when he should be interested in the education of all of our children.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "A government department that\u2019s sending out letters to people who are terminally ill warning them that their benefits could be cut in April even though Parliament hasn\u2019t yet approved these changes.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And a Prime Minister who at the same time as taking away childcare tax credits from working mums, wants to abolish the 50p tax rate.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "All in in together? No, they\u2019re just interested in a few.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And that\u2019s why people will be looking to us to help them. And so as we head back home let\u2019s be proud of who we are and of how our politics can change things. Just look around this great city of Liverpool to see what we can do.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "It\u2019s quite easy to have a go at politicians \u2013 and sometimes we deserve it. And yet being an MP or a councillor is an honourable job. It is a privilege to serve the public.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And that\u2019s why all these boundary changes are so wrong and so damaging. For the Tories it\u2019s all about trying to gain party advantage, but for the rest of us they will destroy the relationship between places and communities and their MPs, and we will fight them as hard as we can.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And we won\u2019t allow millions of people to be thrown off the electoral register because of individual registration. Aung San Suu Kyi reminded us this week just how precious the right to vote is. And that right must be protected for all our citizens.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And if anyone says to you \u2013 ah, you\u2019re all the same, what\u2019s the point, nothing ever changes \u2013 remind them of Labour\u2019s NHS, forged in the aftermath of a world war. Remind them of Labour\u2019s minimum wage and the winter fuel payment. Remind them of the schools and hospitals we built. Remind them of Tom Watson and Chris Bryant\u2019s courage in standing up against Murdoch. Remind them of Ed Miliband\u2019s belief in a something for something society.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And then ask yourself: what would things be like without them ? Do we make a difference? Of course, we do.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And then go out there \u2013 ignore the cynics \u2013 and look people firmly in the eye and say: we are here to stand shoulder to shoulder with you in your community, and in your workplace, and in our Parliament as together we face the future.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And do you know what matters more than anything else? Confidence. Having confidence in ourselves as a nation. Yes, the challenges are great, but if you look around you can see that we have all the skill, passion, innovation, inventiveness, creativity and determination we need.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And when we put the power of our politics at the service of the people, then together we can transform lives and build something better.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Conference, we are now going to hear from someone for whom what we did in Government to support families really made a difference, but also about how her life and her family have been affected by this Government\u2019s dismantling of the help we put in place.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "It is a moving story about why politics matters.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "She comes from Stone in Staffordshire. It is her first time at Conference.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Will you please welcome Catherine Gregory.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body"
