        "Happy New Year! As you read this \u2013 maybe like me \u2013 you are thinking about some New Year\u2019s resolutions. In politics, politicians make resolutions all the time.",
        "Pledges and promises \u2013 the difference is these are made to the electorate, so it\u2019s more important they\u2019re actually kept. I\u2019m looking at you, Ruth Davidson.",
        "In June 2017 the Scottish Tory Leader said she would make sure her 13 MPs would \u201cmake Scotland\u2019s case forcefully\u201d at Westminster.",
        "She also said she wanted \u201cto ensure that we can look again at issues like Brexit, which we know we are now going to have to get cross-party support for \u2013 and move to a consensus within the country.\u201d",
        "Well, where do I start? What a load of nonsense.",
        "Ms. Davidson, here\u2019s a list of resolutions for your MPs- it\u2019d be a good place for them to start.",
        "1) Stand up for the Single Market. Unlike the SNP, not a single Scottish Tory voted to protect the UK\u2019s membership of the single market and customs union \u2013 putting hundreds of thousands of jobs, and people\u2019s incomes and livelihoods under threat.",
        "2) Actually look again at Brexit. Not a single Scottish Tory MP voted to ensure a meaningful parliamentary vote on the Brexit deal. So much for \u2018looking again\u2019 at Brexit- you should have joined the SNP in the lobby.",
        "3) Don\u2019t give away Devolution. Unlike SNP MPs, not a single Scottish Tory MP voted to safeguard Scotland\u2019s devolution settlement in the recent EU bill. Instead, you voted to give UK government ministers unfettered powers to amend or repeal the Scotland Act and retain devolved powers. Ignoring devolution is hardly acting in Scotland\u2019s best interests.",
        "4) Halt the roll-out of Universal Credit. While thousands of people in Scotland are facing poverty and crisis as a result of Universal Credit cuts, delays and errors, not a single Scottish Tory MP voted for the successful motion to halt the roll-out. One Scottish Tory, Douglas Ross MP, missed the vote entirely to earn almost \u00a32000 in his second job as a referee. Unbelievable.",
        "5) Make pensions fair. Unlike SNP MPs, twelve of the thirteen Scottish Tory MPs failed to vote to improve Pensions for women who have been affected by UK government moves to speed up increases in the state pension age and who will lose out financially.",
        "6) Don\u2019t forget that DUP deal. When Theresa May gave Northern Ireland \u00a31billion in exchange for DUP support, the Scottish Tories broke their promise to speak out and secure a deal for Scotland. Where\u2019s our billions, eh?",
        "7) Protect Scotland\u2019s Budget. Unlike SNP MPs, Scottish Tories backed the cuts to Scotland\u2019s budget in the last UK budget.",
        "8) End Austerity: Scottish Tory MPs have backed the continued austerity cuts in the UK Budget in November, including the benefits freeze, the rape clause, and the public sector pay cap \u2013 pushing more families in Scotland and across the UK into poverty, debt and destitution."
