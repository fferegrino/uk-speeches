    "summary": "The speech made by Peter Bone, the Conservative MP for Wellingborough, in the House of Commons on 13 June 2022.",
    "content": [
        "I congratulate the hon. Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East (Stuart C. McDonald) on getting the urgent question, but I will not congratulate him on the language that he used, or the shadow Home Secretary on the language that she used. Mixing up the difference between smugglers and traffickers shows little knowledge of the subject.",
        "We hear that a number of the people who were to be on the flight to Rwanda tomorrow have somehow\u2014miraculously\u2014got some leftie lawyer to intervene and stop it. May I suggest to the Minister that instead of booking 50 people on to each flight to Rwanda, he books 250 people so that, when half the people are stopped from travelling, we would still have a full flight? Come on\u2014get on and send them.",
        "**Tom Pursglove**",
        "As ever, I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his suggestion, which I very much take on board. For obvious reasons, I am not in a position to comment on operational matters, but his point is well made and well argued, as his points often are."
