    "content": [
        "I\u2019m backing Rishi Sunak. He is an exceptional talent that the country knows & trusts to look after the UK in difficult times. The furlough scheme is still credited with saving businesses locally.",
        "Westminster has also been mad as a box of frogs for too long. I think Rishi Sunak has the best chance of restoring calm and replacing the politics of politics on the tellybox with reality, hard truths when necessary and what Parliament can really do for every day people."
