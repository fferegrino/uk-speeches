        "What steps is my right hon. Friend taking to promote the Government\u2019s Healthy Start scheme, and to ensure that eligible families receive the vouchers to which they are entitled?",
        "**Gillian Keegan**",
        "I thank my hon. Friend for his question. The Healthy Start scheme, on which we are working with the Department of Health and Social Care, delivers healthy foods and milk for women over 10 weeks\u2019 pregnant or anyone with a child under four. Beyond this, our investment in families is very important, and we are also investing \u00a3300 million in the Start for Life family hubs, which will complement all of the others. We will of course make sure that people are aware of all the schemes in those family hubs."
