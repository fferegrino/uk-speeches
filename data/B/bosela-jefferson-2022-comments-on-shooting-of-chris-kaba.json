        "**INTERVIEWER**",
        "[How did you hear about the death?]",
        "**JEFFERSON BOSELA**",
        "The police claim that Chris died around midnight, but the family found out at 11 o\u2019clock, you know, so that was 11 hours later. So his Mum would have woken up, gone to work not knowing that her son wasn\u2019t alive anymore. You know, and yesterday at the vigil, that that\u2019s one thing that she kept saying, \u2018I didn\u2019t even spend the last few minutes of your life with you, what was you saying Chris, was you asking for me?\u2019 and that was like heart wrenching.",
        "**INTERVIEWER**",
        "[Did the police come and tell her the news?]",
        "**JEFFERSON BOSELA**",
        "I\u2019m not sure if it was the IOPC [Independent Office for Police Conduct] or the police. One of them came in eventually and told her.",
        "**INTERVIEWER**",
        "[Asked what the family felt like now that a police officer had been suspended and an investigation had begun]",
        "**JEFFERSON BOSELA**",
        "Well, we welcome that decision. Let\u2019s be honest, I think the second a criminal investigation was opened he should have been suspended from there. In fact, the IOPC are moving a bit too slow. You know, first we wanted a criminal investigation opened and that took for three to four days, and then the officer being suspended took another two days. So it seems that there is no urgency in the dealings of this quite tragic matter.",
        "**INTERVIEWER**",
        "[Asked whether the family were happy to let the investigation run its course or whether they had questions of their own]",
        "**JEFFERSON BOSELA**",
        "We definitely have questions, for example, you know initially we wanted to find out whether the car had been searched on Wednesday, even though the incident happened on Monday night, they couldn\u2019t tell us that. Eventually they told us that the car was searched, but they couldn\u2019t tell us if whether found a weapon. They then told us after three hours, so you know, they\u2019re very slow, but the question we\u2019re asking now is, were they following the car or were they following Chris? Because what they\u2019re saying is that the car was flagged in our ANPR[ Automatic Number Plate Recognition] system, but now we know that the car was not registered in Chris\u2019s name. So that means that it could have been anyone in that car. We need to know the difference between whoever they were following Chris, or whether they were following the suspected owner of the car.",
        "**INTERVIEWER**",
        "[This is crucial, was Chris in his own vehicle?]",
        "**JEFFERSON BOSELA**",
        "It wasn\u2019t registered in his name, I can tell you that much. He was alone in the car as well at the time, but whether or not that was his own car I can\u2019t confirm or deny. But, I can say it wasn\u2019t registered in his name.",
        "**INTERVIEWER**",
        "[Is it possible that it was the car which had been linked to a firearms incident earlier?]",
        "**JEFFERSON BOSELA**",
        "If that\u2019s what the police watchdog are saying and, you know, they\u2019re carrying out a criminal investigation and I\u2019m not here to confirm or deny that. But that\u2019s not necessarily the matter here, the matter is whether Chris was unlawfully killed by a police officer. There is no evidence the car was linked to firearms because I\u2019ve known people and heard of people who were in vehicles which were linked to firearms and they came out alive. So the question is, what went on in the night that led to him being killed? This is why the family are immediately and urgently demanding that we see both body cam footage of the incident and also aerial footage that was taken from the helicopter.",
        "**INTERVIEWER**",
        "[Asked whether the family had asked the Met for this or whether it was now part of the investigation]",
        "**JEFFERSON BOSELA**",
        "As much as the property belongs to the police, and the IOPC right now are dealing with the investigation, so they have the property or the information, so we\u2019ve demanded it from them. I think it was yesterday that we we sent a request, or the day before, so we\u2019re waiting for updates on that.",
        "**INTERVIEWER**",
        "[Asked if the family had been given a timescale for the investigation]",
        "**JEFFERSON BOSELA**",
        "No, no, we have not. They\u2019ve been extremely vague throughout the whole investigation in terms of just very simple details, for example, was the car registered to Chris? It took us nearly a week to find out. So equally when it comes to them explaining how long the investigation will take, they\u2019ve been just as vague, telling us it\u2019s like how long is a piece of string. They\u2019re not really being helpful and I think that definitely causes a lot of upset, not just for the family, but for the local community as well.",
        "**INTERVIEWER**",
        "[Asked how close he was to Chris]",
        "**JEFFERSON BOSELA**",
        "I was really close to him, he was my cousin, he was more more like a best friend. We\u2019re really, really tight and even though we didn\u2019t speak every single day, when whenever I saw him it was always love. I always say that he had a gift of making people feel special and I definitely felt that.",
        "**INTERVIEWER**",
        "[Asked if they were the same age]",
        "**JEFFERSON BOSELA**",
        "I\u2019m 27, he\u2019s 24, or he was 24.",
        "**INTERVIEWER**",
        "[Asked if they grew up closely together]",
        "**JEFFERSON BOSELA**",
        "Yes, 100%, we grew up extremely close as we\u2019re Congolese. For those who know the Congolese community, we\u2019re quite a small community in London so everyone knows each other, which means we\u2019re probably a bit closer and more tight than the the ordinary community or the ordinary family.",
        "**INTERVIEWER**",
        "[Asked how his mother was coping]",
        "**JEFFERSON BOSELA**",
        "She\u2019s just absolutely gutted, she\u2019s just devastated and she doesn\u2019t know why this happened. She\u2019s questioning God, she\u2019s asking God like what did I do so wrong for this to be for me? She\u2019s just in pain, she\u2019s just inconsolable. Every meeting we\u2019ve had with the IOPC in which his Mum has been attending, she\u2019s just been crying throughout. She\u2019s cried throughout every single meeting, whether it was with the lawyers or the IOPC."
