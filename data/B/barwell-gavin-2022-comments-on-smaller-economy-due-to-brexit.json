        "The latest estimate suggests our economy is 5.5% smaller as a result of Brexit. My former colleagues don\u2019t want to talk about this (nor do Labour), but it explains something else they don\u2019t like: the high tax burden \u2013 tax revenues would be \u00a340 billion higher.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "It\u2019s important to acknowledge this is only an estimate \u2013 we\u2019re trying to compare what\u2019s happened with what might have happened had we remained. We can\u2019t know the latter for sure, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t produce good estimates, @JohnSpringford, who produced this estimate, has tweeted a thread of his own this morning explaining the assumptions behind this estimate and responding to Brexiteer critiques of them.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Note that some of the impact was immediate after the referendum decision (ie it would have happened whatever version of Brexit we went for); whereas some happened after we left the transition period (ie it was the result of the particular version of Brexit Johnson chose).\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "To give an idea of the scale of the impact, the March 2022 Budget raised taxes by \u00a346 billion. In broad order of magnitude terms, these tax rises would not have been necessary if we had remained in the EU.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Our politicians can\u2019t go on ignoring this economic self-harm forever. That doesn\u2019t mean we have to rejoin, but it does mean we need to reduce the very damaging barriers to trade that we have introduced with our nearest neighbours. It is clear now that was an act of self-harm.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body"
