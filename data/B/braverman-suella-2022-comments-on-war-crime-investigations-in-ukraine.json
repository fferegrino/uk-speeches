        "Russia has brought barbarity to Ukraine and committed vile atrocities, including against women. I am pleased to have led the UK delegation of war crimes experts to Ukraine and to have met those leading Ukraine\u2019s journey to justice, including the indefatigable Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova. I am determined that British expertise will help Iryna and her team to uncover the truth and hold Putin\u2019s regime to account for its actions. Justice will be done."
