    "content": [
        "Today I met with our expert teams at Dover and Manston who work tirelessly to save lives and protect the UK\u2019s borders. I saw first-hand how we\u2019re working to reduce the number of people in Manston, support people there, and thank staff for all their efforts.",
        "I am incredibly proud of the skill and dedication shown to tackle this challenging situation here on a daily basis.",
        "This is a complex and difficult situation, which we need to tackle on all fronts. We need innovative solutions. To break the business model of the people smugglers, we need to ensure that the illegal migration route across the Channel is ultimately rendered unviable."
