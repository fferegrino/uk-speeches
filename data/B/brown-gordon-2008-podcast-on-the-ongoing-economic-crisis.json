    "summary": "The text of the podcast made by Gordon Brown, the then Prime Minister, on 2 November 2008.",
    "content": [
        "I wanted to speak to you about what\u2019s happening with the economy because I know that these events around the world can seem totally bewildering.",
        "When we talk about 25 trillion dollars being wiped from global share prices these are figures just too big to comprehend. But what isn\u2019t hard to understand is that it means that things are going to get tougher for all of us.",
        "When I\u2019ve been speaking to people around the country what they really want to know is whether they can get on with ordinary life in the midst of these extraordinary times. people have been asking if their pension savings are safe and whether they\u2019ll be able to afford a normal family Christmas this year.",
        "One woman wrote to me to say that the day we made the announcement about protecting British savers in Icesave was the first time she had been able to sleep in four days.",
        "And so if you only remember one thing I say today I want it to be this: I\u2019m prepared to do whatever it takes to keep you and your family safe.",
        "This Government will always stand by the side of people on modest and middle incomes.",
        "So let me tell you a little bit about what we\u2019ve already done and why.",
        "First we\u2019ve taken fast action to save British banks. We haven\u2019t done that to help the bankers, but to help people like you who put away money in the bank, or need a loan to buy a house or start a business.",
        "Basically what happened was the banks lost confidence, and so they stopped lending to each other and then on to you. The system got frozen so we needed a big injection of liquidity to get money moving around the system again.",
        "The next thing we did was to provide new capital for the banks, making 37 billion pounds of investment. That\u2019s not public spending like the money we spend on schools and hospitals, but a stake we have bought in the banks that provides a double return.",
        "Firstly it works in the public interest because the banks can keep on doing their job \u2013 lending to businesses who want to expand and families who want to buy a home \u2013 and secondly, because we\u2019ve made the investment on commercial terms and will get a fair share of any return.",
        "We\u2019ve done our bit, so we\u2019re determined the banks will do theirs.",
        "All banks getting public money need to pass some tough hurdles \u2013 that they won\u2019t reward the executives who have gotten them into this mess in the first place, that there will be no cash bonuses this year for people sitting on the board of banks we are supporting.",
        "So that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done to strengthen the banking sector so it can keep on lending to families and businesses.",
        "The second thing we\u2019ve done is to design a package to help small businesses. We\u2019ve been meeting the chief executives of banks to make them lend to small businesses, we\u2019ve made a pledge as government that every bill we owe to small businesses will be paid within ten days and we\u2019ve secured four billions of funding for small businesses to help tide them over.",
        "The third thing has been to act to protect homes. We\u2019ll be giving more and faster help with the mortgage payments to those who lose their jobs and judges have issued new guidance so they can\u2019t order a repossession of your home unless all other avenues have been examined.",
        "That means they look at options like extending the terms of your mortgage, or changing what kind of mortgage you have, or looking at a way of deferring payment, before they can even consider forcing you to sell your home.",
        "So whatever we can do as one country, we have done. but when",
        "\u00b7 dubious mortgages in America can bring down banks in Europe  \n\u00b7 or a Scottish bank can be brought to its knees by out of kilter assets right across the world  \n\u00b7 or when bad investments out of Iceland can affect the whole of Eastern Europe",
        "then we know that we\u2019re in this together. And so we also need a fourth plan of action: a strategy that brings the world together.",
        "There are International Financial Institutions that are supposed to protect us.",
        "Next month I\u2019m going to go and represent Britain in the first of a series of world summits to push the proposals that Britain has been arguing in favour of for some time.",
        "We need",
        "\u00b7 transparency, so we know what each bank is doing  \n\u00b7 integrity, responsibility, so people can\u2019t take reckless risks with your money then walk away  \n\u00b7 sound banking, so people can\u2019t take risks they can\u2019t afford, and  \n\u00b7 better world governance, so that the rules aren\u2019t just national when we know that the behaviour is international.",
        "I\u2019ll level with you \u2013 getting through all this isn\u2019t going to be easy.",
        "And I want you to know that I\u2019m always thinking about what is best to protect you and your families.",
        "Thanks for listening."
