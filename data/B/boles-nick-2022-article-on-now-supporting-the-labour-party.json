    "summary": "A section of the article in the Guardian newspaper on 29 September 2022. Nick Boles was the Conservative MP for Grantham and Stamford from 2010 to 2019.",
    "content": [
        "Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng possess a level of intellectual self-confidence usually found among undergraduates. They always have. Since 2010, when all three of us were first elected as Conservative MPs, they have known what they believe \u2013 and have viewed those who didn\u2019t agree with them, or didn\u2019t share their unshakeable certainty, with amiable contempt.",
        "\u2026.",
        "In the past few days, the values of sterling and government bonds have registered the alarm felt by international investors about the UK\u2019s prospects. But the British economy is resilient and there is a limit to how much permanent damage even these two headstrong ideologues will be able to do.",
        "In two years\u2019 time, voters will be given a choice. By then I expect that there will be millions of former Conservative voters who will have tired of being lab rats in Truss\u2019s and Kwarteng\u2019s ideological experiments. They will look for leaders who are prudent, responsible and steady. Who don\u2019t think they know everything. Who listen, and are in touch with people\u2019s everyday concerns. I predict that they will conclude, as I have done, that it is the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, and his shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who best fit the bill."
