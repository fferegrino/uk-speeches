        "Hello Bournemouth \u2013 it is great to be in this lovely town for the first time for Green Party conference, soon after it elected its first Green Party councillor, and just a year after the South West elected its first Green MEP \u2013 and hasn\u2019t Molly Scott Cato done a brilliant job!\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Yes, I am aware that we are following the Liberal Democrats in this venue \u2013 we\u2019re getting used to taking seats from them \u2013 but I promise that\u2019s the only thing we\u2019ll be following them on.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "In the Green Party we know what our policies are, we know that our values and principles are solid, unmovable foundations. We don\u2019t tack around with the political winds: we stand up for what we believe in.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "I know many of you here will be at your first conference. But let\u2019s start with some members who\u2019ve been around for longer. If you were a member of the Green Party before January 1st last year, please put your hand up!\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Thank you \u2013 you\u2019re the veterans.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Now who\u2019s joined after January 1st?\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Welcome \u2018green surge\u2019.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "But I know that many of you are veterans too, veterans of campaigning for free education, veterans of fighting against the privatisation of the NHS, veterans of Transition Towns, Friends of the Earth and many other organisations.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Many new members told me that they had come to realise that lobbying, campaigning, pushing against the closed door of the old politics, just wasn\u2019t going to deliver the results that our economic, social and environmental crises demand.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "We can\u2019t keep electing the wrong people and hoping they\u2019ll do the right things.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "What we need to do is elect many more Greens in the proportional representation elections \u2013 the fair elections \u2013 coming up next May in Wales, in London, and in Scotland.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Now I could ask the Green MP and House of Lords member to put their hands up, but I don\u2019t think you need help identifying them. Of course if we had a fair electoral system Caroline Lucas would have 24 other Green MPs with her in the Commons, but she, like Jenny Jones in the Lords, does the work of at least that many average MPs, so all we can say to them is thank you!\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And who here is a Green Party councillor? Please put up your hand. I want to offer you my thanks, our thanks, for all of your hard work.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And promise you that next year, in the elections in May, we\u2019ll be electing many compatriots to join you. In Bristol, in Liverpool, in Sheffield, and many other cities, towns and villages up and down the country, we built a great foundation in the general election. In a year\u2019s time I look forward to that question raising a forest of hands\u2026 quite appropriate for the Green Party, I think.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "For it\u2019s clearer by the day, that the political times they are a\u2019changing. It\u2019s the time of new politics.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Greek leader Alexis Tspiras this week in his victory speech thanked the European Greens for their support for a different kind of Europe. The clear re-election of Syriza in Greece and the strength of Podemos in Spain are just two examples of the future of politics in Europe.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "In Britain you can measure that not just by the rise of Jeremy Corbyn to the Labour leadership, but by the Green Party\u2019s more than 1.1 million votes in the general election and the \u2018green surge\u2019 that\u2019s seen our membership more than treble. And by the left-positioned SNP\u2019s comprehensive wipe-out of right-wing Labour in Scotland, and the daily-stronger surge in political activism across England and Wales and beyond.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "The pressure is growing against the failed politics of austerity, on the disastrous privatisation of public services, on treating the planet as though it were a mine and a rubbish dump.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "The failings of successive governments in Britain are attracting widespread attention, widespread concern, widespread opposition.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "The United Nations is investigating the Tory government\u2019s treatment of the disabled and breaches of their human rights.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "The world is increasingly questioning the Tory government\u2019s environmental failings. Al Gore led the way this week: \u201cWill our children ask, why didn\u2019t you act?\u201d he said this week.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Judges will also be questioning more and more the abuses of basic human rights, and the destruction of civil liberties in the disastrous Trade Union Bill and the snoopers\u2019 charter.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Politics is heading towards the understanding that social and environmental justice are indivisible \u2013 and essential to all of our futures.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Politics is heading, fast, towards the policies the Green Party has consistently pursued and promoted for decades.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And politics is far more diverse than ever before \u2013 making the argument for long-overdue electoral reform overwhelming, an issue that I hope Jeremy Corbyn will be putting at the top of his political agenda. The government only has a majority of 12 \u2013 a fragile majority that\u2019s already dissolved on a couple of issues. United in a just cause, we can win electoral reform.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "The new politics \u2013 the politics that demands electoral reform \u2013 is a people\u2019s politics, founded in everyday life, everyday struggles.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "On the streets, in community centres and pubs and cafes, online, people are talking together, gathering together, working together \u2013 recognising those immortal words: \u201cYe are many, they are few.\u201d\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Many of you I\u2019m sure were on the streets on June 20th for the People\u2019s Assembly Against Austerity, and again this month at the massive, inspiring Refugees Welcome march.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "At both marches people assembled under many different symbols, under the banners of church groups and the flags of unions, under the homemade placards of the unaffiliated and the organised groupings of long-established campaigns, all saying: \u201cwe\u2019re not going to take this anymore: no more austerity, no more privatisation of public services, no more planet-trashing, and no more of this unfair, inhumane, unjust immigration system\u201d.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "The marchers got their message across, and more than that, they got the message that the Green Party is their party.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "For these growing, increasingly coalescing movements of people power need a political wing. They need representatives at the heart of the places where decisions are made: in local councils, in Cardiff and Westminster, in Brussels.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Campaigners up and down the country are understanding that the Green Party is the natural home of the community campaigner and the Transitions Towns member, the natural home of the campaigner against the privatisation of the NHS and the anti-evictions activist, the natural home of the immigration rights advocate and the defender of environments local and global.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Local parties, far stronger and more numerous than ever before, are able to reach out into new parts of their communities, to offer their help, to be a guide through the frequently forbidding, deliberately opaque bureaucracy of town halls, Westminster and Brussels.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "I know that some commentators are asking: what\u2019s the difference between Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour and the Greens? Communities up and down this country who are dealing with Labour councils know one answer to that.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "They have Labour councils who aren\u2019t listening to them, aren\u2019t meeting their needs, are too often in the pockets of the developers and big business, who believe despite all the evidence that \u2018economic development\u2019 comes from supporting an out-of-town supermarket that destroys local independent businesses by the score.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "When it comes to standing against planned nuclear plants from Hinkley to Anglesey to Hartlepool, when it comes to resisting the power of the oil and gas lobby that keeps supporting this government\u2019s fracking, underground coal gasification and coal bed methane fantasies from Blackpool to Middlesborough to Warwickshire; when it comes to resisting the concreting over of the greenbelt for expensive, poor quality homes by mass builders out for a quick pound, communities know that it\u2019s the Green Party that consistently backs them.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "But we\u2019re not just following and supporting, we\u2019re also leading.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And leading on the issue of climate change \u2013 the issue on which all of our futures, as inhabitants of this one fragile planet, depends.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "The Green Party is at the front of a broad push to make the Paris Climate Talks not just successful in their own terms, but to be a vehicle for putting tackling climate change at the heart of every community effort, the plans of every council, the work of every official.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "We\u2019ve already launched our \u2018Climate Sense\u2019 campaign \u2013 yes that\u2019s the hashtag \u2013 and this is the Green Party\u2019s \u2018Climate Sense\u2019 conference.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Green councillors and parties up and down the country are at the forefront of the broad campaign to get institutions and pension funds to divest from fossil fuels.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And we\u2019ve joined the European Green Party in calling on everyone to share their \u2018climate moment\u2019 \u2013 the second when they as individual human beings recognised that climate change was already here \u2013 and just how urgent it is to change direction before it is too late.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "For me it was January 1st, 2006. Yes, it was New Year\u2019s Day. It was time to make an assessment about the state of my life and the state of the world.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "I\u2019m unusual in British politics in that I have a degree in science, and I took the knowledge from that, looked at the state of the world, and it frightened me. I thought: \u201cI must do something.\u201d\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "So I joined the Green Party. Although I never would have predicted where that would lead me.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And I would not have predicted that in the leader debates before this year\u2019s general election I would have been the only one to talk about climate change. That in three and a half hours, the Labour leader, the Liberal Democrat leader, the Conservative leader, the SNP leader and the Plaid Cymru leader wouldn\u2019t find space for those two momentous words, climate change\u2019.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "That has to change. It has to change now. We cannot have another major political debate that doesn\u2019t have climate change at its heart.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "But I\u2019m a strong believer in the idea that deeds not words are what matter the most when it comes to tackling climate change.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "It does not bode well that, just two months before the crucial Paris climate talks, the Prime Minister last week appointed a fossil fuel industry insider as his key adviser on energy and environment.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "This isn\u2019t just disappointing, it\u2019s scandalous.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "If the Prime Minister is even half way serious about success at the Paris climate talks and tackling the threat of climate change to our security, prosperity and natural world, he should ask for Stephen Heidari-Robinson\u2019s resignation with immediate effect. And instead appoint an advisor without association to a climate-destroying industry. The UK\u2019s green economy is a huge success story \u2013 often in spite of government policy \u2013 so he won\u2019t be short of options.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "This disastrous approach has to change. It has to change now.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "As the Pope said this week, this is a critical moment of history. The problem cannot be left for future generations to deal with.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Dealing with climate change has to be at the centre of every policy, every decision, the responsibility of everyone. If we don\u2019t make that a reality, our children and grandchildren will never forgive us.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "As part of the work towards that, today I\u2019m issuing a special request to every Green Party in the country to hold at least one public meeting to raise this issue up the agenda in their community.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "More, I\u2019d ask everyone listening to take action. Organise a meeting in your community group, in your union, in your university, school or college, in your local pub. The next few months are critical \u2013 please play your part.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "In Scotland a grassroots referendum campaign drew many into political involvement, into issues local and global. We can do the same by taking understanding of the issues around climate change into the heart of every community.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Let\u2019s summon up, to draw on Abraham Lincoln, every better angel of our human nature to this great, the greatest, cause.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Together we can ensure that everyone has the chance to find out more, to understand how tackling climate change isn\u2019t just essential, but also a positive framework that can improve our society, our lives, and the lives of future generations.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And I\u2019d urge everyone not to pin all of their hopes on the Paris talks, but to see this as a stepping stone, one branch of a plan to reshape our societies to live, to thrive, to meet the needs of future generations on this fragile planet.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "I\u2019m going to borrow a phrase from the climate change campaign 350.org: this is the point where everything breaks apart and everything comes together.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "But we can only protect our planet in a fair, humane society. That\u2019s at the absolute core of Green Party values and principles \u2013 and it is at the core of solving our climate crisis.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "For the Green Party is the solutions party. We know that the crises we face in our economy, in our society, in our environment are not happening at the same time by coincidence.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "The cause \u2013 the nature of our economic system, the hypercapitalism of the multinational oil giants and the sweatshop-based fashion chains, the sealife-destroying giant trawlers and the cruel, destructive factory farms, the hugely subsidised private landlords and the zero-hours-contract employers \u2013 are all part of the same system.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And the solutions to deal with the crisis need to tackle these together. It\u2019s joined-up thinking \u2013 the kind of thinking that\u2019s in the Green Party\u2019s DNA.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And it is thinking that demands real change \u2013 when it comes to dealing with our social and environmental crises only 21st-century thinking will do.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "We can\u2019t go back to the failed 20th-century answer of perpetual growth; that can\u2019t continue on a finite planet.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "We can\u2019t go back to the failed 20th-century model of centralised administrative monoliths imposing models on diverse local communities.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "We can\u2019t go back to the idea of a wasteful industrial economy built around giant companies.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "We need new solutions.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "The Green Party has long championed treating our homes as the critical national infrastructure that they are \u2013 a plan to lift nine out of 10 households out of fuel poverty, to create at least 100,000 jobs, and cut carbon emissions. Not bad for just one Green policy!\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "The Green Party has long demanded investment in public transport, not the botched, illogical HS2, but local and regional schemes that help to rebalance our economy, linked to local bus services under the controlling hand of local councils. Such a transport policy would not only tackle congestion and air pollution, but also help to cut the NHS bill for dealing with obesity and diabetes. Not bad for just one Green policy!\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And we\u2019ve long understood that the only secure, sustainable economic future is based in strong local economies, with local needs met by local suppliers, with a rich ecology of farming, manufacturing and services businesses supporting each other.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Think global, act local is a long-term Green vision \u2013 and an essential one to secure our future.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "But there\u2019s no doubt there are forces out there, powerful forces, with huge amounts of cash and influence, who want to keep things just as they are.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "But every day their power wanes, they have to struggle harder for a grubbier, weaker hold.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "They\u2019re in a crisis of legitimacy. They cannot be trusted. They are rotten to the core.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "I was going to say that the emperor has no clothes, but after the news reports of the last week I won\u2019t inflict that image on you\u2026 Even better, I\u2019ve carefully combed this speech to ensure there are no porcine references at all.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "What I will refer to about Lord Ashcroft\u2019s book is his self-declaration that he expected donations of millions of pounds to buy him a place at the heart of the British government. The core is rotten \u2013 it must be removed.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And that\u2019s true also of our financial sector. The list of scandals is almost endless, from Libor to Forex rigging, PPI to money-laundering and tax evasion.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "The finance sector exists not to serve the real economy but to fuel speculation in financial instruments and property that\u2019s become entirely detached from the reality of homes and business premises, to fund its own empty structure. It expects be propped up by the sweat and pain of communities far from the glass towers of Canary Wharf when it fails again.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "We\u2019ve seen just this week another emerging scandal \u2013 a giant, respected, global car manufacturer has confessed \u2013 after it was exposed \u2013 to rigging tests about the emissions from 11 million diesel cars it has manufactured, and put on the streets. And there are questions now about whether it was just that manufacturer.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Our politics is rotten. Our finance sector is rotten. Our industrial sector is rotten. Even some of our sport is tainted. Fifa, in control of the \u2018beautiful game\u2019, is rotten.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "The people newly engaged in politics, the people of Britain overall \u2013 if not the people currently running things \u2013 see very clearly that we cannot continue on our current path.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Increasing numbers of Britons understand instinctively that David Cameron\u2019s \u2018recovery\u2019, built chiefly on consumer debt, has no firm foundations \u2013 and that\u2019s particularly clear to the people of Wigan and Rhyl, Gateshead and Ramsgate \u2013 the many communities that have seen precious little sign of this \u2018recovery\u2019 at all.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "They\u2019re deeply worried, as people across Britain are worried, about the kind of world we\u2019re leaving future generations.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Realism means understanding that massive change is coming, and it can be, if we make the right choices, pursue the right policies, change for the better.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "To achieve that, we need new political structures, as well as new economic, social, environmental structures.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "To get those we need to break the shackles of a 19th-century electoral system.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "There\u2019s one number I\u2019d urge you to remember \u2013 24%. That\u2019s the number of eligible voters who supported this Tory government.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Even if you count the people who chose to vote, the Tories only won 37% of that vote. As a Swedish Green Party minister said to me recently: \u201csurely you can\u2019t form a government with that!\u201d\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "The route to electoral reform is not clear and obvious. In an ideal world the Tory government would say, \u2018clearly the current situation is intellectually and morally untenable and we have to introduce proportional representation, fair elections, for both the Commons and a new House of Lords\u2019.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not holding my breath for that.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "What I am doing is asking Jeremy Corbyn as the new leader of the Labour Party in a parliament where the Tories have an extremely narrow, already tottering, majority, to join with us and others to deliver a fair, simple system in which voters can participate with confidence that their vote counts.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Already the Green Party is working with campaigners, working with other parties, to keep electoral reform, a proportional, fair, electoral system, on the political agenda.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And if that gives Nigel Farage the chance to photo-bomb me in the Mirror, so be it!\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "But we don\u2019t have to wait for electoral reform \u2013 for coming up we\u2019ve got votes in already reasonably fair elections in which voters can simply vote for what they believe in.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Those elections are in London, for its Assembly, in Wales, for its Assembly. In Scotland our sister party has a great chance to increase their parliamentary representation to historic highs, and in Northern Ireland, our fellow Greens will be seeking to increase their Assembly numbers from one to three.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "You\u2019ll be hearing from Pippa Bartolotti, leader of the Welsh Greens, later today, about the exciting prospects of our first Assembly members in Cardiff. And on Sunday you\u2019ll be hearing from Sian Berry, our London mayoral candidate, about the prospects for growth in our Assembly representation.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And here\u2019s a tip: the bookies have Sian\u2019s odds of waking up as London mayor on May 6th considerably shorter than Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s during the Labour leadership contest.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "But next May the prospects are much broader than that.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Since the general election I\u2019ve been travelling the country and visiting new and revived local parties, already gearing up for next May\u2019s council elections \u2013 aiming to win their first councillors, build their local representation, be the challengers, the critical scrutinisers lacking on so many councils.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
