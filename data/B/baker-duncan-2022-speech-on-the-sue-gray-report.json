    "summary": "The speech made by Duncan Baker, the Conservative MP for North Norfolk, in the House of Commons on 31 January 2022.",
    "content": [
        "North Norfolk consistently had some of the lowest levels of infection in the country; we followed the rules. Many of my constituents have been incensed by this matter, and the damage it is doing to the Government is enormous. It is about integrity and trust. May I ask again, because people want to know, how can the Prime Minister satisfy my constituents and assure me that full accountability and transparency on the findings of the final Gray report will swiftly follow?"
