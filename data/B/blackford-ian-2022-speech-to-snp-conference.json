    "summary": "The speech made by Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, on 8 October 2022.",
    "content": [
        "Before I start, I just want to pay tribute to the courage of Lesia Vasylenko who we all had the privilege of hearing from earlier.",
        "A remarkable ambassador for her country and someone who gives us all a real sense of the unshakeable spirit of the Ukrainian people.",
        "Today we renew our support for her, for her country and we also renew our opposition to the Russian aggression, occupation, and Illegal annexation of their country.",
        "Today, tomorrow and every day in the future \u2013 Scotland stands with the people of Ukraine. And let\u2019s make another thing clear. The international community must not rest until the war criminal Putin is put in front of the Hague where he belongs.",
        "Friends,",
        "I have to say \u2013 it really is a joy to be back again at conference.",
        "It feels all the better because this is the first time we have been able to gather together in person since the pandemic changed all of our lives.",
        "And without giving away my age \u2013 for old veterans like me, who first joined this party decades ago when we needed far smaller venues to meet \u2013 it always remains a sight to behold when we gather in such numbers.",
        "And with that in mind, it is maybe worth taking a moment to remember that since we last met at conference, that strength and support for our party has grown even further.",
        "Let\u2019s remember that in the 2019 Westminster election we secured over 80% of the seats here in Scotland.",
        "In May of this year at the council elections we increased our share of the vote, increased our number of councillors, and became the largest party in even more councils. And friends \u2013 most important of all \u2013 we won a landslide at last year\u2019s Holyrood election.",
        "Together we secured an independence majority \u2013 and with it \u2013 the democratic right for the Scottish people to choose our own future.",
        "That record, those results and that success is only possible because of each and every one of you \u2013 our activists who bring our vision and our values to every corner of this country.",
        "And we know too, that story of success wouldn\u2019t be possible without the character, the competence and the calm of our party leader, Scotland\u2019s First Minister.",
        "I\u2019m very tempted to call it \u2018strong and stable\u2019 leadership.",
        "At a time of such challenge and crisis \u2013 let me tell you friends \u2013 we are very lucky to have that leadership. We are all lucky to have her.",
        "Because conference, trust me on this \u2013 you don\u2019t have to spend too long in Westminster these days to realise what happens when that kind of solid leadership that we have in Scotland in government is literally nowhere to be found in government in Westminster.",
        "My job as your Westminster leader is to stand up here and give you all an update on events in London.",
        "Now in fairness, that\u2019s a hard enough job at the best of times. But honestly this year \u2013 especially with the chaos of the last few weeks \u2013 I barely know where to start. They say that first impressions are important in any new job.",
        "Well \u2013 only a matter of weeks into their new roles, the disastrous duet of Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng have crashed the economy, sent the pound plummeting, put pension funds at risk and caused mayhem for mortgage holders.",
        "The Bank of England are having to spend up to \u00a365 billion to prop up the gilt market, to stop pension funds from folding and all because of the chaos caused by Truss and Kwarteng",
        "The truth is \u2013 the new Prime Minister and her new Chancellor have made worst first impression in the history of British politics.",
        "Because the inequality and incompetence of that budget will go down as one of the worst financial interventions in modern history.",
        "By the way \u2013 don\u2019t simply take my word for it \u2013 just ask the mini-budget\u2019s very newest critic \u2013 Douglas Ross.",
        "Ask him quick though \u2013 because no doubt he\u2019ll change his mind again before very long. There was at least one Tory who had the inside track on the disarray what would unfold in the last few weeks.",
        "Now this is the first and definitely the last time I will ever quote Rishi Sunak at an SNP conference \u2013 but credit where credit is due.",
        "He was right when he warned that the Liz Truss plans were \u2018fairytale economics\u2019. But what was once \u2018fairytale economics\u2019 to bribe votes from Tory members in the summer has become everyone else\u2019s nightmare this autumn and winter.",
        "Because these aren\u2019t distant decisions on financial markets \u2013 the chaos of their choices will impact directly and painfully on ordinary households.",
        "Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage costs, a weaker pound means food and fuel prices will go up even further, and the blinding incompetence of it all will mean a longer and deeper recession.",
        "This Tory incompetence comes with a massive price. And it will be paid for the only way the Tories know how \u2013 by cutting public services and pushing more people into poverty.",
        "Already they are gearing up to make real terms cuts to benefits in the middle of this cost-of-living emergency.",
        "And on the very same morning that they finally u-turned on their tax cut for the super-rich, the Tories slipped out the real announcement that they would be slashing public services by \u00a318 billion every year.",
        "The last decade of Tory austerity was only the start.",
        "The Resolution Foundation have predicted that the Chancellor\u2019s choices could mean cuts of \u00a347 billion by the middle of the decade \u2013 cuts at least as big as those by the original austerity Chancellor, George Osborne.",
        "It turns out the new Tory plan is the same as the old Tory plan \u2013 Austerity 2.0.",
        "So conference, here\u2019s a test for the new Conservative rebels who are magically multiplying by the day.",
        "If they have any sense of morality \u2013 if they have any backbone \u2013 they will join with us in stopping any real terms cuts to benefits and any return to austerity.",
        "Because their Chancellor \u2013 clearly in the depths of denial \u2013 even had the cheek to say that the immorality at the heart of his budget was only a \u2018distraction\u2019.",
        "But the Scottish people aren\u2019t distracted one little bit \u2013 we\u2019ve got the message loud and clear during the shambles of the last few weeks.",
        "As our own Alison Thewliss described it \u2013 the Tories are the sole architects of this broke, broken Britain.",
        "Your homes, your pensions, your incomes are not safe under Westminster control.",
        "It is a cost, a risk, a price that Scotland can\u2019t afford to pay any longer.",
        "Because Conference, the reality is that the chaos of the last number of weeks is no exception, it has become the new normal of British politics.",
        "A pattern of constant crisis now defines Westminster. It all started when they boarded that big red Brexit bus in 2016 \u2013 and they have been driving towards disaster ever since.",
        "We all thought it would be Boris Johnson who would eventually drive it over the cliff \u2013 and in fairness to him, he came pretty close.",
        "But it turns out he has left it to Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng to drive the UK economy over the edge. And the sheer stupidity of their grand plan is becoming clearer \u2013 exit the EU only to fall into the arms of the IMF.",
        "Who can forget that these are the same people. who once promised to \u2018take back control\u2019.",
        "Well \u2013 the last few weeks are the clearest evidence as to just how dangerously they have lost control.",
        "We are now left with the remaining rump of a desperate Tory party \u2013 reckless, right-wing, wreckers who should never be allowed anywhere near the privilege of power ever, ever again.",
        "So, let\u2019s make a promise of our own.",
        "Let\u2019s never allow them control over our lives and our future ever again. Not for one term, not even for a decade.",
        "Let\u2019s make sure we win our independence and finally, finally get rid of Tory governments for good.",
        "And conference, when we do finally get rid of them, we know the scale of opportunities that independence will offer. We only have to look at the current context.",
        "Scotland is energy rich \u2013 we simply shouldn\u2019t be facing an energy emergency, we shouldn\u2019t have cold homes and soaring bills.",
        "We produce 6 times more gas than we consume and almost 100% of our entire electricity consumption comes from renewables.",
        "This is Scotland\u2019s energy, and it that should serve Scotland\u2019s people. Instead, we are locked into a UK energy market that means the wholesale price of our energy is linked to gas. That needs to change but it will only change with independence.",
        "We need to take the Westminster handbrake off Scotland\u2019s green energy potential.",
        "Yesterday, the Westminster group launched a new report worked on by myself, Stephen Flynn and Alan Brown \u2013 mapping out the road ahead and the opportunity before us.",
        "From offshore and onshore wind, hydrogen, solar, tidal and carbon capture, we have a golden opportunity to lead an energy transition that secures net zero, enhances energy security and lowers energy costs for consumers.",
        "By 2050 \u2013 through expanding Scotland\u2019s renewable capacity as well as becoming a green hydrogen exporter \u2013 we have the chance to pump \u00a334 billion into Scotland\u2019s economy every single year \u2013 an investment that will sustain 385 thousand jobs.",
        "This is the new, green revolution that independence offers \u2013 it is what Scotland\u2019s future will be built on.",
        "And not just a green energy revolution but the power to build a new green industrial strategy, driving investment and creating jobs.",
        "Delivering that greener, prosperous, fairer Scotland that we all strive for.",
        "But conference, that future is only possible if we choose a different path from Westminster. Because if we don\u2019t \u2013 we will be dragged even further in the wrong direction.",
        "There is no better example of that than the B word that barely gets a mention anymore \u2013",
        "And I don\u2019t mean Boris \u2013 I mean Brexit.",
        "The vow of silence \u2013 the omerta of daring to speak Brexit\u2019s name \u2013 needs to finally end.",
        "We need to name it and shame it for the disaster it has been. A disaster for our farmer\u2019s, for our fishing communities, for our young people.",
        "The damage of Brexit will keep on biting unless our country finds its way back into our rightful home in the European Union",
        "And Conference, when it comes to Brexit, I\u2019m afraid I can only think of one sentence more ridiculous than the Tory\u2019s \u2018Get Brexit Done\u2019. And that\u2019s Labour\u2019s new slogan \u2013 Make Brexit Work.",
        "Never before have so few words made so little sense. The complete conversion of the Labour Party to the Tory hard Brexit party is a betrayal of working people in Scotland and across the UK.",
        "And of course, that\u2019s not all.",
        "As well as pledging their support Brexit, Labour\u2019s other big pledge is never to work with us in the SNP.",
        "The very same Labour party who only a few months ago made a string of backroom deals with the Tories.",
        "But just think about that for a second.",
        "A Labour party happy and hungry to do backroom deals with the Tories but who say they could never work with us.  \nAnd why?",
        "Because we happen to believe in our nation\u2019s independence, we happen to believe that our people have the right to choose our own future.",
        "Labour\u2019s position is not just an insult to all of us, it is as much an insult to the many Scottish Labour voters who also believe in independence.",
        "Labour are now a Brexit backing, democracy denying, Tory enabling party. As Keir Starmer himself said at his conference \u2013 \u2018Don\u2019t forget, don\u2019t forgive.\u2019",
        "Well Keir, I\u2019m very confident the Scottish people never will.",
        "Conference, that newly formed Brexit Together coalition of Labour and Tories carries another major risk.",
        "Just like Internal Market Bill before it, the newly published and so-called \u2018Brexit Freedoms\u2019 Bill is another blatant attempt at a power-grab on Scotland\u2019s Parliament.",
        "Time and time again, Brexit is being used as a blunt Westminster tool to systematically pick apart our Parliament\u2019s powers.",
        "Because all of these trojan horse Brexit bills ride roughshod over the devolution settlement. They give UK ministers the power to act within devolved areas without consent from the Scottish Government.",
        "This new power grab also carries the real risk that laws protecting rights and standards \u2013 such as holiday pay, parental leave, and the 48-hour work week, as well as good air and water quality \u2013 will fall away and disappear.",
        "And all because the Tories are hell bent on getting rid of any law, any right, any protection that have the words European Union in it.",
        "Well in Scotland, we value those laws, those rights and those protections.",
        "We value the European Union. And we will find our path back to where we belong \u2013 in Europe \u2013 when we achieve our independence.",
        "Friends, getting back to where we belong feels like an appropriate theme this weekend. Because as we gather here, we remember and celebrate the remarkable life of Ian Hamilton \u2013 the man who liberated the Scotland\u2019s stone of destiny and brought it home to where it rightfully belongs.",
        "Ian\u2019s life is a rich reminder of those who came before us, those who first blazed the trail for our country\u2019s independence.",
        "His was a life of commitment and full of political purpose.",
        "A life and a vision that stands in such stark contrast to what passes for politics in Whitehall these days.",
        "Because in many ways the constant crisis at Westminster in the last few weeks and over the last number of years stems from the truth that it has no clear path and no clear purpose.",
        "They are leaderless and they are lost. But thankfully for Scotland we no longer have to be bound by their choices and their control.",
        "We now have the chance of a different choice, the choice of a different future. Because we can\u2019t and won\u2019t be shackled to the shambles that Westminster has become.",
        "With independence- we have that clear purpose and a clear path.",
        "The independence papers show the way, they show the opportunity and the future we can build together.",
        "So friends \u2013 for Ian Hamilton and for all those who have gone before us, for those of us in Scotland today \u2013 and most of all \u2013 for future generations.",
        "Let\u2019s finish the job, finish the journey and finally put a finish to Westminster control for good.",
        "Let\u2019s build that greener, wealthier, fairer future.",
        "Let\u2019s build a new Scotland \u2013 an independent Scotland."
