        "Conference, let me apologise for not being with you in the hall right now.",
        "But sometimes you have to strike a balance between argument and action \u2013 and when it comes to youth unemployment what we need right now is action.",
        "So I\u2019m here with Tony Lloyd at the fantastic Manchester College.",
        "Where we\u2019ve brought employers, colleges, business with apprenticeships, and hundreds of young people to see what we can do to get young people in this city into jobs.",
        "And what I\u2019ve heard this morning is just wrong.",
        "It\u2019s wrong that young women like Nazish have been out of work six months, desperate for a job or apprenticeship.",
        "It\u2019s wrong that young men like Colm who\u2019s 23 have been out of work since July.",
        "This is the economics of the madhouse.",
        "You know our welfare is rising by \u00a329 billion.",
        "And yet people like Colm and Nazish and a million others just like them and hungry to work and are forced to stand idle.",
        "Now as some of you know, I represent the constituency in Britain where youth unemployment is highest.",
        "What I\u2019ve realised is that the anger we feel about youth unemployment is the anger we feel when we see our values under attack.",
        "We believe in the pride and dignity of work. That\u2019s why we\u2019re called the Labour Party.",
        "We believe that we\u2019re stronger when we pull together as a country. We don\u2019t believe in the economics of you are on your own.",
        "We believe in an economy that works for working people.",
        "And we believe that when you see an injustice, you don\u2019t just walk past it.",
        "You roll up your sleeves and you do something about it.",
        "Today every single one of those values is under attack and it\u2019s our young people paying the price.",
        "So we have to take a stand.",
        "That\u2019s why Labour are calling for a real jobs guarantee \u2013 paid for by sensible tax on bankers bonuses.",
        "And, we have to organise the fightback.",
        "We can\u2019t and won\u2019t stand on the sidelines and watch our young people take a kicking.",
        "So today I\u2019m very proud to launch our Youth Jobs Taskforce.",
        "Just because we\u2019re not in government doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t make a difference.",
        "We run Wales, and London\u2019s big boroughs and Britain\u2019s big cities.",
        "Right now it\u2019s our councillors and local leaders who leading the charge for youth jobs: thinking, organising, making a difference to get young people work.",
        "Today, these local leaders are coming together in a new coalition to galvanise action.",
        "They are going to join forces with good people from our trade unions, from business, from enterprise, from civil society, and from our youth movement.",
        "We want to make sure that the best ideas anywhere, become the way we do things everywhere.",
        "We know how high the stakes have become.",
        "The young people we serve are good people.",
        "They don\u2019t dress up in white tie and smash up restaurants.",
        "And they don\u2019t swear at policemen.",
        "They are people who want to work hard and get on in life if only someone will let them.",
        "And today we send an emphatic message: that we are on their side.",
        "Let me just finish with a story.",
        "You know Iain Duncan Smith likes to boast that he was once inspired in his reforming zeal to smash up the welfare state by what he saw in Easterhouse in Glasgow\u2019s East End.",
        "Well last week I too went to Easterhouse, together with the great Margaret Curran.",
        "To meet a group of young people to talk about the future.",
        "What they say inspires them, isn\u2019t yet another Tory attack.",
        "It\u2019s investment in skills. In jobs. In chances.",
        "Those young people are just like people we\u2019re here with today.",
        "They\u2019re people who want to rebuild Britain.",
        "And Labour is going to help them.",
        "Because we\u2019re the party that knows how futures are really built.",
        "It\u2019s built by people like those behind me here in Manchester today \u2013 and a million more like them all over the United Kingdom.",
        "They might have a do-nothing Government.",
        "But they\u2019re going to have a do-what-it-takes Labour Party.",
        "So thanks for listening.",
        "I\u2019ll let you know how we get on a bit later.",
        "If you\u2019d like to get involved in the taskforce, drop me a line: we\u2019d love to have your help.",
        "And I\u2019ll catch up with you later this afternoon."
