        "Conference.",
        "You\u2019ve been so good to me this week.",
        "It\u2019s not every day that you lose a leadership election and your team goes bottom of the league.",
        "I am proud of my campaign. I said in my own words what I felt needed to be said.",
        "But I am proud of our new Leader too \u2013 the spokesman for a new generation and our next Prime Minister.",
        "Conference, you know me now. I will give him all my support to make that happen.",
        "But I can\u2019t deny that we didn\u2019t have our disagreements on the campaign trail.",
        "Picture the scene \u2013 early Sunday morning, on the train to the Cardiff hustings, Ed and his team were sitting in our reserved seats.",
        "It\u2019s fair to say that, if we\u2019d known then what we know now, we probably wouldn\u2019t have turfed him out!",
        "But he\u2019s right \u2013 a new generation is ready to lead Labour forward.",
        "We are more united than any other time in our history.",
        "We are ready to rise to the big challenges of our time, drawing inspiration from Labour\u2019s post-war generation.",
        "The way older people have to pay for care today is as great an injustice as health care before the NHS.",
        "A cruel \u2018dementia tax\u2019 where vulnerable people empty their bank accounts and surrender their homes \u2013 not the British way, but as brutal as American healthcare.",
        "And it\u2019s about to get a whole lot worse.",
        "David Cameron\u2019s cuts to councils will put half a million older people at risk \u2013 left alone without help, piling yet more pressure on family carers, paying even more out of their own pockets.",
        "Ending the injustice of the \u2018dementia tax\u2019 in this century of the ageing society will be for Labour a cause as great as any that has gone before.",
        "A National Care Service free at the point of use \u2013 paid for by a care levy \u2013 will give peace of mind to everyone in later life and let them protect what they\u2019ve worked for.",
        "It will be for Labour in this century what the NHS was for us in the last \u2013 proudly proclaiming our values to the world, showing how they can build a better and fairer society.",
        "A big, inspiring idea in the best traditions of our Party \u2013 that\u2019s the way to Reconnect Labour.",
        "But it means rediscovering the courage of our convictions.",
        "Thank God Nye Bevan wasn\u2019t the kind of man who worried about what the Daily Mail might say. If he was, we might never have had an NHS.",
        "So, going forward, let\u2019s worry a bit less about what the media might say and do what we know to be right.",
        "Bevan called the NHS: \u201ca real piece of socialism\u201d.",
        "Today, it is Britain\u2019s most cherished institution.",
        "But it is now facing the biggest attack in its 62-year history.",
        "A White Paper out of nowhere that will unpick the very fabric of our NHS and turn order into chaos.",
        "They are the wrong reforms at the wrong time \u2013 and a bad deal for patients.",
        "Before the Election, Mr Cameron said his priority could be summed up in three letters: NHS.",
        "Barely a week went by without a photocall alongside NHS staff.",
        "No mention of the bombshell he was about to drop on them.",
        "My message today to the Prime Minister is simple: you can\u2019t pose as the friend of the NHS on one day and rip it to pieces the next.",
        "People will not forgive you for it.",
        "You have no mandate for the break-up of a successful NHS.",
        "Patients aren\u2019t asking for it.",
        "GPs and NHS staff don\u2019t want it.",
        "The public did not vote for it.",
        "I say to you today \u2013 put these dangerous plans on hold.",
        "Give the NHS the stability it needs.",
        "If you don\u2019t, get ready for the fight of your life \u2013 and the public will be on our side, not yours.",
        "You made promises to patients and NHS staff \u2013 we won\u2019t let you betray them.",
        "Conference, on some things, though, David Cameron has been true to his word.",
        "Do you remember how in the Election he promised to look out for the \u2018Great Ignored\u2019?",
        "Well, to be fair, he has. Nick Clegg could not have had a warmer welcome into the Tory fold.",
        "And it\u2019s hard to ignore Nick now, isn\u2019t it?",
        "Nick, if you don\u2019t mind, a bit of advice: your tie doth protest too much. The yellower it gets, the more you look and sound like a Tory.",
        "That\u2019s today\u2019s Liberal Democrats: Tories in yellow ties.",
        "But I\u2019m told the Lib Dems are happy with this new image. In fact, they\u2019ve already picked a campaign song for the next Election to promote it.",
        "It\u2019s a remake of a classic love song based on the Tory tree logo.",
        "It\u2019s called: \u2018Tie a yellow ribbon round the old oak tree\u2019.",
        "Now we all know Nick likes the spotlight. But, incredibly, he is planning to sing the key lines himself in a very personal appeal to his friend David:",
        "\u2018So tie a yellow ribbon round the old oak tree",
        "It\u2019s been three long years, do ya still want me?\u2019",
        "But, Conference, this is a tear-jerker. Nick goes on to open up his heart about his fear of rejection on campaign trail:",
        "\u2018If I don\u2019t see a yellow ribbon round the old oak tree \u2013",
        "\u2018I\u2019ll stay on the bus (he must mean his battle bus), forget about us, put the blame on me.\u2019",
        "Make no mistake, Nick.",
        "If you and your MPs nod through the break-up of the NHS, we will put the blame on you.",
        "Not just us \u2013 but the seven million people who voted for you too.",
        "They didn\u2019t vote for this.",
        "You didn\u2019t tell them you would allow your friend Dave to carve up the NHS \u2013 a service which is today the envy of the world.",
        "In June, a respected international think tank gave this verdict on the NHS: the 2nd best health care system in the world and top on efficiency.",
        "Conference, feel proud of that \u2013 the final word on Labour\u2019s NHS.",
        "No-one can take it away from us, however much they try to re-write history.",
        "But it\u2019s all at risk. 13 years of careful work \u2013 staked on the roll of a dice. A 1000-piece jigsaw thrown up into the air.",
        "It makes me want to weep.",
        "Before the ink was barely dry on a Coalition Agreement which promised \u2018no more top-down reorganisations of the NHS,\u2019 we get the biggest and most dangerous ever.",
        "A epic U-turn from a Government fond of pious statements on restoring trust in politics.",
        "What changed, Mr Cameron? I think shell-shocked NHS staff deserve an answer.",
        "But patients deserve answers too.",
        "It\u2019s our job, Conference, to tell them what this plan means.",
        "Waiting times getting longer again with the scrapping of our maximum 18-week wait \u2013 and our cancer targets.",
        "They deride them as \u2018process targets\u2019.",
        "But with cancer, process equals time, and time saves lives.",
        "Patients facing that familiar Tory choice in healthcare \u2013 wait longer or pay to go private \u2013 as the private patients\u2019 cap is lifted",
        "A postcode lottery writ large, with up to 500 GP groups making different decisions.",
        "Vulnerable patients \u2013 people with mental health problems, rare conditions or complex needs \u2013 left without the guarantees and certainty they need.",
        "For staff, it means the end of national pay structures which bring stability to the system.",
        "I was proud to make the public NHS my preferred provider. But now staff have no guarantees that they\u2019ll be working in the NHS in five years time.",
        "These reforms have nothing to do with what is best for the NHS \u2013 and everything to do with ideology.",
        "It is nothing short of scandalous to spend up to \u00a33 billion on a political experiment with our NHS at a time when every single penny is needed to maintain jobs and standards of patient care.",
        "They are an attack on the N in NHS \u2013 a frightening vision of a fragmented health service, where markets rule, competition trumps cooperation, private sector giants outbid the NHS and profits trump patients.",
        "No wonder morale is at rock bottom.",
        "Tens of thousands of decent, hard-working PCT staff have been told they are simply expendable.",
        "It\u2019s no way to treat loyal people who helped put the NHS back on its feet.",
        "I tell them today that I value your contribution and the country should too.",
        "We have GPs wondering when they signed up to become the managers of markets and multi-million pound budgets.",
        "Ian spoke for many when he said: \u201cDon\u2019t destroy what we\u2019ve spent many years building up.\u201d",
        "Lansley says listen to GPs \u2013 well it\u2019s about time he did the same. If the Royal College of GPs and the BMA can\u2019t support your plans, something is seriously wrong.",
        "A chorus of protest \u2013 from patients, nurses and now even GPs \u2013 is rising across the country.",
        "It is aimed at a Tory Party that voted 51 times against the NHS.",
        "It\u2019s never been safe in their hands and it\u2019s not safe now.",
        "So, Conference, let the message go out from here today that we\u2019re getting ready for the battle of our lives.",
        "People need to know that their beloved NHS will never be the same again if this madcap plan goes ahead.",
        "I call on all of you to sign up today.",
        "Put your name on Labour\u2019s Defend Our NHS petition and recruit friends to do the same.",
        "Let\u2019s build an army of NHS defenders in every community in the land.",
        "Let\u2019s take the fight for a universal, public NHS to every street and doorstep.",
        "Let\u2019s give heart to those demoralised NHS staff, who do so much for us all, that Labour will stand up for them and defend what they believe in.",
        "And let\u2019s show this arrogant Government the might of this Labour movement when it fights as one.",
        "To those who say we can\u2019t win \u2013 16,000 people have already proved you wrong.",
        "We saved NHS Direct.",
        "And well done John Prescott for that.",
        "Conference, we can and must win.",
        "We will win.",
        "Because the public will be willing us on.",
        "They didn\u2019t vote for this.",
        "Mr Cameron, you have picked the wrong fight.",
        "We are a resurgent Labour Party \u2013 and nothing matters more to us than the NHS.",
        "It is the best thing about Britain today.",
        "Labour\u2019s finest achievement.",
        "Conference, defend it with everything you\u2019ve got \u2013 and get ready for the fight of our lives.",
        "Thank you."
