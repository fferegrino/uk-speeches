    "summary": "The speech made by Peter Bottomley, the Conservative MP for Worthing West and the Father of the House, in the House of Commons on 17 November 2022.",
    "content": [
        "**Sir Peter Bottomley (Worthing West) (Con)**",
        "The Chancellor will have noticed that Labour Members laughed when he talked about stability, growth and public services. Those who are watching our proceedings will have noticed, as will he, that when he was making his announcements about how we will ease the burden on the poorest and give opportunities to those who most need them, those Members were silenced. People around the country will give backing to his approach. We may have arguments about details, but the key point is to get stability and growth, and to defend public services.",
        "**Jeremy Hunt**",
        "I thank my hon. Friend the Father of the House. He is right. What I have discovered in the short time that I have been doing this job is that although one might arrive thinking that decisions about money are about numbers and spreadsheets, they are actually about values. Today, I have tried to express our values not just as a Conservative party but as a country. That means protecting the most vulnerable."
