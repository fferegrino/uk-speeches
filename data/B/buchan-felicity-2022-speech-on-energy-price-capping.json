    "summary": "The speech made by Felicity Buchan, the Conservative MP for Kensington, in the House of Commons on 8 September 2022.",
    "content": [
        "I warmly welcome this bold, decisive and comprehensive measure, which is exactly the right thing to do. I particularly welcome the measures on communal heating networks, which are huge in my constituency with all my mansion blocks.",
        "I like that we are focused on self-reliance. I tried to intervene on the Leader of the Opposition, because he rightly talked about self-reliance when it comes to energy, but part of the reason why we are not self-reliant is because, between 1997 and 2010, the Labour party failed to invest in renewables and other sources of energy, so our dependence on gas went from 32% to 46%.",
        "All the measures announced today are welcome. I welcome the commitment to net zero, and I welcome the investment in renewables."
