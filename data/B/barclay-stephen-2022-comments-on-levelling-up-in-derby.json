    "content": [
        "Derby is a city of real vibrancy and it was fantastic to see the ambitious regeneration projects taking place across the city centre.",
        "The redevelopment of the Market Hall is really starting to take shape and the \u00a315 million Future High Streets funding will help develop other parts of the St Peter\u2019s Quarter.",
        "Levelling up is a central part of the Government\u2019s ambition because we want to ensure people and communities up and down the country are able to thrive, so it was great to see how Derby has been able to access funding that will drive inward investment into the city centre and create opportunity for people."
