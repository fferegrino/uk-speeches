        "The US is our single most important trade, defence and security partner. We share the same values \u2013 freedom, free trade and the rule of law. Our special relationship means together we are a force for progress as we face down countries who threaten these values.",
        "The Atlantic Future Forum represents an incredible opportunity for our two nations to exchange skills, ideas and technology. Every morning, over a million people get up and go to work for British companies in America, and over a million do the same for American companies in the UK.",
        "The UK is a low-tax, high-talent, innovation nation and I will show America\u2019s biggest companies that we are ready to be their investment partner of choice."
