    "summary": "The speech made by Kemi Badenoch, the Secretary of State for International Trade, in New York on 28 September 2022.",
    "content": [
        "Thank you and good afternoon everyone.",
        "How wonderful it to be at the Atlantic Future Forum.",
        "This a superb event organised by the Royal Navy and our teams from the Department for International Trade, the Ministry of Defence and of course the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.",
        "It is particularly poignant being on HMS Queen Elizabeth given the events of the last few weeks.",
        "To say it\u2019s been emotional would be an understatement. For everyone in the UK, young or old Her Late Majesty had been ever presence of force in British Life. Many of us here were more than her subjects we were Her Majesty\u2019s Ambassadors, Her Majesty\u2019s Civil Service, Her Majesty\u2019s Armed Forces, Her Royal Navy, Her Government.",
        "Our late sovereign was also, of course, a stateswoman, who devoted herself to deepening the special relationship.",
        "So it is a particular privilege to stand on this vessel which she named at Rosyth Dockyard 8 years ago, as we begin the Carolean age in the service of His Majesty.",
        "And talk about an important aspect of the US and UK\u2019s shared future and by that I mean\u2026our economic partnership.",
        "I lived briefly in the US, and learned very quickly that Americans and New Yorkers especially, like to cut to the chase.",
        "So, I\u2019m going to get straight to the point:",
        "Right now, there\u2019s a global growth slow-down underway.",
        "And if you\u2019ll forgive the pun, we need all hands on-deck to get the world economy\u2019s wheels spinning again.",
        "And that\u2019s why in the UK we\u2019re going for growth in a big way. And in fact some of you may have heard some major reforms we announced on Friday, to achieve this:",
        "But before I go into what we are doing, it would be odd not to address the elephant in the room.. and the financial instability in markets over the last few days.",
        "You would by now have heard the Bank of England taking short-term measures to provide stability \u2013 as is their job.",
        "My colleagues, including the Chancellor, continue to work very closely with our institutions to support them in their aims while maintaining their independence. And we must look at all of this in the context of the fundamentals, which are that the UK economy is strong and we have a plan \u2013 a Growth Plan to cut taxes, promote enterprise and cut red tape for business.",
        "So what are some of the things we\u2019re doing?",
        "We\u2019re keeping corporation tax at the lowest in the G20 at 19% not cutting keeping.",
        "We\u2019re creating low tax investment zones around the country, to make it quicker and easier to build and get things done because the regulatory environment has not kept pace with our economic needs.",
        "We\u2019re accelerating critical infrastructure projects in sectors like transport, energy, and telecoms\u2026to ensure we invest in our future and deliver for the next generation.",
        "We\u2019re also going to be spending 3% of GDP on defence by 2030. Something I know looking at all of the uniforms in the room is especially relevant to all of you here today.",
        "We\u2019re rolling out significant financial services reforms that will make the UK an even better place to do business and much more.",
        "There is radical change happening on our side of the Atlantic. It\u2019s the kind of radical change that we\u2019ve not seen for 40 years.",
        "We know it is bold.",
        "We know it comes with risk.",
        "But in these volatile times, every option, even the status quo is risky.",
        "And the Prime Minister, my predecessor but one in my role as Trade Secretary gets trade and knows that our global economic relationships have got to be at the heart of this work.",
        "Right now, US-UK trade is booming. Sadly, not enough people know this or hear the message enough. So I want to make sure they do and I\u2019ll continue to bang the drum.",
        "But it\u2019s the investment story that\u2019s even more interesting.",
        "Increasing numbers of American firms are realising that backing the UK is a great move.",
        "I could make your eyes glaze over by trotting out an endless list of statistics! Don\u2019t worry I\u2019m not going to do that today",
        "\u2026.. but the numbers speak for themselves:",
        "US businesses already invested \u00a3479 billion pounds into in our economy \u2013To put that figure into context it\u2019s more than Sweden\u2019s annual GDP.",
        "Every day just under 1.5 million Britons go to work for an American firm.",
        "And in the year to March alone, American investment created 27,000 British jobs.",
        "I know to some extent I\u2019m preaching to the choir here.",
        "Because I don\u2019t have to look far around this room to spot businesses that are boosting their UK operations.",
        "In fact, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, are just some of the American firms here today that have said they will do precisely that. And we look forward to working with them.",
        "Undoubtedly, factors like good infrastructure, our legal system and a lack of red-tape, are part of the UK\u2019s attraction.",
        "But there\u2019s another reason too. We are fast becoming the world\u2019s innovation destination.",
        "Just like Manhattan, we\u2019re an island full of dynamism and ingenuity.",
        "We\u2019re the nation with big ideas.",
        "We\u2019re Europe\u2019s unicorn factory.",
        "And the first quarter of this year our tech start-ups attracted more global investment than anywhere bar the US\u2026..and partnerships between UK and American firms are pushing forward progress\u2026..",
        "For instance, there\u2019 s a really interesting story taking place right now involving a firm in Cambridge called PhoreMost and a business named Polaris Quantum Biotech from North Carolina.",
        "Together, they want to cut the time it takes to create cancer therapies. That\u2019s not only a great business partnership, it\u2019s literally a life-saving collaboration.",
        "But I want to do even more to make sure American ambitions collide with British ideas or vice versa.",
        "So here\u2019s my elevator pitch. The UK is pro-ambition, pro entrepreneur, pro-growth and home to top-flight talent fizzing with extraordinary ideas.",
        "And we are more determined than ever before to turn the country into the place to come if you want your business to succeed.",
        "Of course, we mustn\u2019t pretend everything is perfect or easy. We know that, sometimes trading our way to growth can be more difficult than it needs to be.",
        "But it\u2019s because the US and UK are close that we can fix problems wherever we find them.",
        "Look at the way we recently solved the Section 232 tariff dispute on UK steel and aluminium exports and reached an understanding on the Airbus-Boeing dispute.",
        "Very soon, Americans will be able to pick up a leg of Welsh lamb at their local store for the first time in decades, after a long-standing rule was removed.",
        "That\u2019s obviously big news for British farmers. And it\u2019s arguably even better news for Americans who get to tuck in on some of the finest grass-fed lamb in the world\u2026",
        "And, of course, we\u2019re delighted that bourbon is fully back on the drinks menu, in Britain, following the Section 232 resolution.",
        "I know that behind the scenes we\u2019re working hard to resolve issues and make it quicker, easier and cheaper for our firms to do business.",
        "The UK also sees the huge potential to develop our relationships with individual states as another huge opportunity.",
        "In May, under the stewardship of my predecessor, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, who is also here today, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding on trade and economic cooperation with Indiana \u2013 a state that already buys $1.4 billion worth of UK goods every year.",
        "North Carolina followed in July.",
        "And I know the DIT team is working hard on continuing Anne Marie\u2019s legacy with me and securing more this year\u2026so watch this space.",
        "Given we\u2019re anchored not far from the Statue of Liberty, I want to end by saying a few words about trade as a force for progress and a force for good.",
        "Free markets and fair trade are very personal to me.",
        "Too many people trot them out as cliches and platitudes, but a world without these freedoms is not just poorer it\u2019s also more dangerous.",
        "I grew up in Nigeria. And I saw first-hand what happens when a nation can\u2019t trade or worse embraces protectionism.",
        "Not long ago, the government there banned rice and tomato not tomayto tomato imports to support local industry. The result was not a boom in production, but supply shortages, price rises and people smuggling in tomatoes like they were diamonds.",
        "I will never forget the sight of my mother a university professor stuffing her suitcase with Tesco Value Rice when she visited me in London because it was cheaper there than back home for her.",
        "One of the many reasons I\u2019m so frustrated by the trope that Brexit was the UK retreating from the world, is because it is completely untrue. I voted to leave the European Union and I saw Brexit as a once in a generation opportunity for the UK to embrace the world and trade was and still is at the heart of that.",
        "So I want to make sure that we use our freedoms to build better and fairer trading relationships with emerging economies.",
        "When trade is open and free and everyone plays by the rules, we will win and developing countries gain an alternative to authoritarian regimes.",
        "But at a time when weaker economies are being exploited by those who don\u2019t share our values, it\u2019s not enough to talk about why free and fairtrade matters, we need to show why too.",
        "Last month, my department launched the Developing Countries Trading Scheme. It\u2019s one of the most generous initiatives of its type in the world and it\u2019s going to give a boost to businesses in 65 countries by cutting red tape and lowering tariffs.",
        "It\u2019s early days but I\u2019m already hearing how the scheme is giving entrepreneurs in countries like Bangladesh the opportunities they need to grow their businesses. And closer to home, I\u2019m very much focused on exploring how trade can support the reconstruction of Ukraine.",
        "Of course, the UK-US trading relationship couldn\u2019t be a better illustration of capitalism\u2019s power to influence, unite and act as a counter to protectionism and authoritarian regimes.",
        "And We\u2019re already using trade to tackle some of the biggest issues facing the world.",
        "At last year\u2019s G7 we renewed our Atlantic Charter; originally signed by Churchill and Roosevelt pledging UK and US economic and security collaboration.",
        "Through our Future of Atlantic Trade dialogues, we\u2019re working on critical issues, such as developing and diversifying our supply chains in response to the war in Ukraine and the pandemic.",
        "We\u2019re deepening our ties in the Indo-Pacific through our AUKUS pact.",
        "Our response to the Indo Pacific region\u2019s rapid growth and China\u2019s growing assertiveness, is another shared challenge.",
        "And I know we\u2019re both committed to opposing economic coercion, and the unfair trade practices that choke competition and penalise countries that follow the rules.",
        "President Ronald Reagan once said: \u2018Free trade serves the cause of economic progress and it serves the cause of world peace.\u2019",
        "And the UK-US economic partnership is the clearest possible example of why free trade and free markets are not just integral to our growth but to the freedoms we share.",
        "Next month, we\u2019ll mark the 75th anniversary of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \u2013 the forerunner of today\u2019s multilateral system.",
        "Our nations helped to forge that deal after WW2, following long negotiations.",
        "At GATT\u2019s heart was an acknowledgement that free and fair trade would be key to our future.",
        "Again today, we face unprecedented challenges.",
        "Again, at times, we may have differences\u2026",
        "But just like the American and British teams who gathered round the negotiating table three quarters of a century ago.",
        "I know we are committed to deepening our transatlantic economic partnership.",
        "Building our businesses\u2019 bonds of commerce.",
        "And demonstrating, unequivocally, how through free trade we can together create a better world. Thank you."
