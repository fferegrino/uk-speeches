    "summary": "Below is the text of the speech made by Brendan Barber to the TUC Women\u2019s Conference on 14th March 2012.",
    "content": [
        "Thanks Max [Hyde]",
        "Thanks for your hard work on the Women\u2019s Committee and with the NUT.",
        "And thanks everyone for inviting me to address your conference.",
        "Let me begin by congratulating Evelyn Martin from the GMB for winning the women\u2019s gold badge and being awarded the MBE last year.",
        "Let me congratulate Michelle Stanistreet for being elected as NUJ general secretary last April \u2013 the first ever women to hold this post.",
        "And conference, let me also say a few words about two outstanding women trade unionists who we sadly lost over the last year \u2013 Marge Carey from USDAW, and Terry Marsland who made her mark with the Tobacco Workers\u2019 Union, Tass and MSF.",
        "Both were working-class women who grew up in Liverpool.",
        "Both devoted their lives to improving the lot of ordinary women.",
        "And both were an inspiration to us all.",
        "We will never forget them.",
        "Conference, you are meeting once again at a time of tremendous difficulty for ordinary women and their families.",
        "The facts speak for themselves.",
        "Women are twice as likely to be affected by government cuts as men.",
        "Women are being disproportionately hit by the pay freezes, pension reforms and massive jobs cull in the public sector.",
        "And women are continuing to bear the brunt of an economic crisis largely caused by the testosterone-fuelled antics of male bankers in the City.",
        "Earlier today, it was announced that women\u2019s unemployment has reached its highest level in a quarter of a century.",
        "Over 1.1 million women are now without work. The number of unemployed women aged between 50 and 64 has risen by 20,000 over the past quarter. And female unemployment has risen by nearly 25 per cent in the North East in the last year.",
        "But the headline statistics \u2013 however bad \u2013 tell us nothing about the countless personal tragedies unfolding right across Britain.",
        "The female graduate told to start her own business because there are no jobs.",
        "The young mother unable to find work because of a lack of childcare.",
        "And the woman in her fifties made redundant now fearing she will never work again.",
        "Like 52-year-old Helen from London.",
        "A community care worker for 10 years who lost her job back in 2009.",
        "She hasn\u2019t worked since.",
        "As Helen says: \u2018I\u2019ve been for interviews, I send my CV off all the time, but there is nothing. It\u2019s so depressing, so frustrating, I don\u2019t know what to do\u2019.",
        "Conference, let\u2019s be clear: the jobs crisis facing women is a national scandal \u2013 and we will not stand by while this government destroys the lives, livelihoods and aspirations of millions of women in this country.",
        "Think too about all the other things the coalition is doing.",
        "Funding for the EHRC slashed.",
        "Changes to the state pension age that disadvantage half a million women.",
        "Plans to cut maternity leave to 18 weeks \u2013 or zero if Steve Hilton gets his way.",
        "Hard won abortion rights at risk.",
        "Basic employment rights deemed to be red tape.",
        "Legal aid cut mercilessly.",
        "Refuges for victims of domestic violence closed.",
        "Colleagues, the evidence is clear: this is the most female-unfriendly government in living memory.",
        "With women bearing the brunt of the coalition\u2019s policies, with so few women supporting the government, what has Number 10\u2019s response been?",
        "To appoint a new tsar for women. To say a few warm words about getting more women onto company boards. To talk about tax breaks for people who employ cleaners and servants.",
        "Conference, let\u2019s be clear: this is a government that knows absolutely nothing of the lives led by ordinary women in Britain today.",
        "If there\u2019s one statistic that shows just grotesquely unequal our country has become, then it\u2019s surely this.",
        "The richest 1 per cent of the population \u2013 the people the government desperately wants to cut tax for \u2013 already claim more in tax reliefs each year than the typical woman working in the private sector earns in a year.",
        "That\u2019s not just deeply shocking; it\u2019s a moral abomination that shames our society.",
        "So how, in the midst of austerity, do we win fairness, equality and justice for women?",
        "How do we respond to the government\u2019s attacks on women\u2019s rights, jobs, and services?",
        "And what can we in the trade union movement do to make a difference to the lives of the most vulnerable, disadvantaged women in our society?",
        "Let me describe what I think must be our three key priorities in the year ahead.",
        "First priority: we\u2019ve got to set out our alternative to austerity.",
        "With the cuts hitting women hard, it\u2019s our job to show there is a better way to get our economy back on track.",
        "Ministers want us to believe that austerity will be worth it in the long run; that the sacrifices we are making now will pay dividends at some indeterminate point in the future.",
        "But we need to get the message across that it won\u2019t like this \u2013 that austerity means high unemployment, stagnant wages and falling living standards for the duration.",
        "Instead we need to give ordinary working people \u2013 ordinary women \u2013 a sense of hope about their prospects.",
        "That\u2019s why, over the past year, the TUC has made the case for a different strategy based on growth, jobs and tax justice.",
        "Keeping our economy moving, keeping people in work, and keeping tax revenues flowing \u2013 with those at the top making a proper contribution at long last.",
        "In a sense we\u2019ve got to shift the terms of the debate from deficit reduction to economic renewal.",
        "Because it\u2019s only through building a fairer, stronger economy \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad- providing decent work for all \u2013 that we\u2019ll be able to deal with our debts in the long term.",
        "As Keynes once said: \u2018look after unemployment and the budget will look after itself\u2019.",
        "And this takes me onto our second priority: we\u2019ve got to keep fighting the cuts in our workplaces and our communities.",
        "What we\u2019ve got to do is build on the huge success of our massive mobilisations of March 26th and November 30th last year \u2013 in which women of course played such a prominent role.",
        "Not just working alongside all those organisations \u2013 from charities to women\u2019s groups \u2013 who share our concerns about the scale and speed of the cuts.",
        "But also reaching out to those millions of people from every walk of life \u2013 men and women; black and white; young and old \u2013 who believe in a better, more hopeful vision for Britain\u2019s future.",
        "A big part of the task we face is showing just how devastating the cuts are to the everyday lives of people of all backgrounds.",
        "And the good news is you\u2019re already leading the way of that front.",
        "Thanks to the excellent \u2018Women and the Cuts\u2019 toolkit which was launched last autumn, you\u2019re already building up a detailed picture of how austerity is affecting women in communities the length and breadth of Britain \u2013 complemented by the mapping exercise you are now undertaking.",
        "Our task is simple: to make this kind of work the norm not the exception right across our movement \u2013 giving us the evidence, the testimonies, and the arguments we need to take apart the government\u2019s case for cuts.",
        "So to our third priority: we\u2019ve got to get organised.",
        "As vital as our campaigning work is, there can be no substitute for effective trade union organisation in the fight against austerity.",
        "Recruiting workers into trade unions, encouraging them to get active, rebuilding our collective strength: that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do now.",
        "And with union density higher among women than among men, once again you are showing how it is done.",
        "Proof of the old adage that women need unions; and unions need women.",
        "At a time when women are being hit hard by the cuts; when it is women who account for the majority of the 710,000 jobs being slashed across our public services; and when women are often being shoehorned into lower-paid work in the private sector -assuming they\u2019re lucky enough to find it \u2013 the case for stronger organisation is surely unanswerable.",
        "And as you know better than me, the way to bring women into the fold is to focus on the issues that matter most to them.",
        "So let\u2019s speak up for equal pay, better childcare and decent jobs.",
        "Let\u2019s support a woman\u2019s right to choose.",
        "And let\u2019s show our commitment to ending violence against women.",
        "And where better to start than by encouraging trade union members to support the petition calling on the UK government to sign to the Council of Europe\u2019s Convention on Violence Against Women?",
        "Conference, do not underestimate what you can achieve through collective action.",
        "Your theme this year could not sum it up any better: \u2018Every woman in every workplace: stronger together\u2019.",
        "And in the year ahead, as we face our toughest test in a generation, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve got to be: stronger together.",
        "Stronger together as we fight the cuts.",
        "Stronger together as we set out our alternative.",
        "And stronger together as we win fairness for ordinary women and their families.",
        "Thanks for listening and have a great conference."
