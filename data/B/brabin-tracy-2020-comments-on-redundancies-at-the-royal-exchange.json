    "content": [
        "The devastating news from the Royal Exchange is just the latest sign of a sector in crisis. Theatres have been warning of mass redundancies for months but the government fails to listen.",
        "They have had enough of warm words from the Secretary of State, what they need is a sector specific package to support them while coronavirus makes live performances impossible.",
        "There is a real fear that once we lose some of these jobs \u2013 not only will it be devastating for the individuals \u2013 but the loss of talent and expertise will cause lasting damage to the nation\u2019s cultural heart."
