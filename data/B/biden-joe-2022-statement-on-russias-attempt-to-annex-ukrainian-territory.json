    "summary": "The statement made by Joe Biden, the President of the United States, on 30 September 2022.",
    "content": [
        "The United States condemns Russia\u2019s fraudulent attempt today to annex sovereign Ukrainian territory. Russia is violating international law, trampling on the United Nations Charter, and showing its contempt for peaceful nations everywhere.",
        "Make no mistake: these actions have no legitimacy. The United States will always honor Ukraine\u2019s internationally recognized borders. We will continue to support Ukraine\u2019s efforts to regain control of its territory by strengthening its hand militarily and diplomatically, including through the $1.1 billion in additional security assistance the United States announced this week.",
        "In response to Russia\u2019s phony claims of annexation, the United States, together with our Allies and partners, are announcing new sanctions today. These sanctions will impose costs on individuals and entities \u2014 inside and outside of Russia \u2014 that provide political or economic support to illegal attempts to change the status of Ukrainian territory. We will rally the international community to both denounce these moves and to hold Russia accountable. We will continue to provide Ukraine with the equipment it needs to defend itself, undeterred by Russia\u2019s brazen effort to redraw the borders of its neighbor. And I look forward to signing legislation from Congress that will provide an additional $12 billion to support Ukraine.",
        "I urge all members of the international community to reject Russia\u2019s illegal attempts at annexation and to stand with the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes."
