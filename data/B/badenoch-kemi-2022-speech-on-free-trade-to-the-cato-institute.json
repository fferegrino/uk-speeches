    "summary": "The speech made by Kemi Badenoch. the Secretary of State for International Trade, in Washington DC on 14 November 2022.",
    "content": [
        "Thank you Ryan, that\u2019s a fantastic and accurate introduction. So thank you, it\u2019s a real pleasure to be speaking this evening at the CATO Institute. It\u2019s lovely to see so many people who\u2019ve come to listen to what I have to say on trade!",
        "So I\u2019ve been in the role of Trade Secretary for two months now under two Prime Ministers, and there is a tendency when speaking to think-tanks to talk about the importance of free trade.",
        "But this is the CATO Institute, and if I have to explain to this audience why free trade is important then we have some very serious problems.",
        "So, instead, I\u2019d like to talk very personally about what Free Markets and Free Trade mean to me.",
        "Many of you may not know, but I grew up in Nigeria and moved to the UK when I was 16.",
        "Where I did grow up had military governments and so I have a first-hand experience of authoritarianism and protectionism that I think is quite unique, and it\u2019s unique not just in the UK, but in what we call \u201cthe West today\u201d.",
        "I think it\u2019s actually quite extraordinary that I\u2019m standing here in front of you as the UK\u2019s Trade Secretary but here I am, and here\u2019s what I want you to know.",
        "When I talk about a belief in free trade, it\u2019s not empty rhetoric. I\u2019m speaking from personal experience about what happens when you don\u2019t have it. I\u2019ve seen what happens when a nation can\u2019t trade or worse embraces protectionism.",
        "The result isn\u2019t growth and the nurturing of local industries which is always the excuse that people give. The result is poverty, and the very best of a country\u2019s talent leaving to find opportunities elsewhere.",
        "People worry about the free market and they talk about this as if it\u2019s an uncontrolled experiment, but the market is people having the freedom to make choices to improve their lives. It does need good regulation, so that people don\u2019t cheat the system, it needs good regulation to prevent unfair trading practices, monopolies and exploitation of consumers.",
        "So it\u2019s not an untraveled free market, but you do need to have free trade and free markets because when you don\u2019t, weird things happen.",
        "So I talk about things that I\u2019ve seen growing up. For example when the government wanted to improve the tomato industry in Nigeria and so it banned tomato imports. And what didn\u2019t happen was loads of farmers deciding to grow tomatoes, what instead happened was tomatoes becoming like diamonds in terms of how hard it was to get them.",
        "The supply dried up completely, the prices went up, big companies that used tomatoes as an ingredient cornered the market, and people who needed to use them to just make food\u2014caterers, restaurants, people for whom that was almost the only vegetable they had, couldn\u2019t access it because that\u2019s not how you grow a local industry.",
        "And I saw it happen over and over again with finance, capital controls turning the currency into wastepaper effectively.",
        "Or, a story I love to tell about when the government banned rice imports and rice became a black market product.",
        "And when my mother came to visit me in London, her suitcase was not full of things from Harrods and Hamleys, it was full of Tesco value rice which she packed right up to fill her entire suitcase. For those of you who know what I mean by Tesco value rice it became a very, very precious commodity.",
        "That\u2019s what a lack of free trade and free markets creates, and there\u2019s dozens and dozens of examples that I could give but, like I said, at CATO I shouldn\u2019t have to explain why that is.",
        "But the reason why I talk about it is because I\u2019m fighting for something I really believe in. Free markets and free trade make the world a better place and that is the only purpose to becoming a politician. Nothing else matters.",
        "So why has the world become more protectionist? I think that\u2019s a more interesting question rather than preaching to the choir about the benefits of free trade and free markets.",
        "Why has the world become more protectionist? Everyone here knows that protectionism is not the answer.",
        "The US and the UK have done a lot to expand the concept of free trade \u2013 especially in the last 75 years, we founded the multilateral trading system with our allies, and our transatlantic partnership embodies why free trade works and why it matters so much.",
        "But one of the many reasons I\u2019m so frustrated by the trope that Brexit was the UK retreating from the world, is because it is completely untrue. I voted to leave the European Union and I saw Brexit as a once in a generation opportunity for the UK to embrace the world. And trade was \u2013 and still is \u2013 at the heart of that.",
        "So why does it feel like everyone is becoming more protectionist?",
        "And the answer is uncertainty. We live in uncertain times.",
        "A global pandemic that changed our understanding of the world, Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, and a more assertive China are just three of the things that are making people more fearful about the future.",
        "Relatively low economic growth in the West over recent decades compared to what people are used to has also caused a part of this problem. So what can we do? What do we need to provide more security for the people of the world. That relative low economic growth is absolutely terrifying, and for those people who saw the post war 20th century it makes a lot of our contemporaries feel poorer than they actually are. And if you compound that with the belief that their jobs are being taken away either by technology or offshoring, it is no surprise that the instinct is to protect what we have.",
        "So if we are going to make people feel less protectionist, we\u2019re going to have to make them feel more secure first. And we need to show how free trade and free markets, when done properly, do provide security.",
        "So trade as a tool of security is at the very heart of the trade policy that I\u2019m going to be pushing as the UK\u2019s Trade Secretary. The US and UK can provide security and indeed certainty by doing three things:",
        "One, investing in the future, not just the present.",
        "Two, Securing and diversifying supply chains, which means more trade, not less.",
        "And three, deepening international partnerships, which is one of the reasons I am here.",
        "Here are some examples of how we\u2019re doing this in the UK in just one area \u2013 so let\u2019s talk about climate change as an example.",
        "Two weeks ago, I launched the UK\u2019s Green Trade and Investment Expo securing millions of pounds that will grow our economy and create jobs across the industries of the future.",
        "We all know that climate change is a challenge for us all, wherever we live in the world. But we know that we can and should solve it by using free trade and investment to accelerate the technological progress that will protect the planet. And something that not enough politicians say, we must do this, we must protect the planet in a way that does not impoverish the UK, the US or let\u2019s be honest any other country.",
        "I talked then about securing and diversifying supply chains. We will need this to improve energy security globally.",
        "So back home in Europe, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has made it clear that relying on authoritarian regimes for energy is not sustainable. Doing so has made it harder and more expensive to heat our homes and the ensuing energy crisis has increased inflation to levels not seen in recent memory.",
        "So our trade relationships will help secure our energy supply. But it\u2019s long-term investment in nuclear, in renewables in democratic countries that will reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and keep down consumer costs.",
        "And trade is more than selling each other goods and services, it\u2019s also about foreign direct investment. Technological investment creates the jobs of tomorrow.",
        "I said to all those investors who came to the Expo from around the world, including the US, investment can future-proof the economy if we get it right.",
        "More importantly, as we\u2019re seeing in the UK it drives economic growth and keeps communities alive. Communities such as Blyth in the North East of England which was a coal mining town once in decline, but is now thriving as it becomes one of the UK\u2019s most important bases for offshore wind and is driving the clean energy revolution, funded by investors from across the world \u2013 including here.",
        "And that\u2019s just on climate change.",
        "Now that we\u2019ve left the European Union and have an independent trade policy what does this look like in practice?",
        "Well, we\u2019re using our new freedoms to negotiate new trade deals and upgrade existing ones\u2013 deepening our ties with our allies while creating new economic partnerships.",
        "We\u2019re joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans Pacific Partnership, or CPTPP as we call it \u2013 it\u2019s a network of 11 countries, spanning from Asia to the Americas, it\u2019s got Canada and Mexico in it, maybe the US someday \u2013 but it covers at the moment half a billion people.",
        "We\u2019re strengthening our relationships with our partners and allies in the Indo Pacific, a region that will be responsible for half of global growth in the coming decades. We\u2019re thinking about the future.",
        "We\u2019re in talks on a free trade deal with India. India\u2019s a country that\u2019s going to be the world\u2019s third biggest economy by 2050.",
        "We\u2019re acting to protect global supply chains after Covid-19 and of course the invasion of Ukraine revealed so many vulnerabilities.",
        "And what do we want from the US?",
        "Well, we\u2019ve made no secret that we want to deepen trade ties through a comprehensive free trade agreement. So those of you who want more free trade with the UK, please write to your Congressman. And I hear there\u2019s some new ones this week.",
        "But the lack of an FTA is no barrier to boosting trade.",
        "Our trading relationship with the US was worth over $250 million over the past 12 months.",
        "So we are each other\u2019s number one source of foreign direct investment. More than 1.2 million Americans work for UK companies in the United States, and every day just under 1.5 million Brits go to work for an American firm.",
        "So the UK has been nimble and innovative in finding other ways of working with you beyond free trade agreements.",
        "For instance, we\u2019re signing Memorandum of Understandings on a state-wide level.",
        "In May, we signed one on trade and economic cooperation with Indiana \u2013 that\u2019s a state that already buys $1.4 billion worth of UK goods every year. North Carolina followed in July.",
        "And my team is securing others and looking to sign even more.",
        "So as I said, I\u2019m here to continue deepening our international partnership.",
        "Our trading relationship does not just build itself. We need to work at it. That doesn\u2019t just mean giving speeches about how much we love each other, it also sometimes means fixing problems and offering challenge when required.",
        "So while I\u2019m here, I\u2019ll also be raising our concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act. We know this was a strategic step to protect the US economy and we also know that there\u2019ll be many people in DC, and across the country who support it.",
        "But it\u2019s important these measures don\u2019t conflate long standing allies and partners like the UK, with those other countries that might want to damage US interests.",
        "So everyone here knows the ins and outs of the Inflation Reduction Act. However, you may not know that the substantial new tax credits for electric cars, not only bars vehicles made in the UK from the US market, but it also affects vehicles made in the US by UK manufacturers.",
        "So the investment and innovation taking place in the UK should be helping the US with tomorrow\u2019s challenges.",
        "US businesses already have over $500 billion invested in our economy \u2013 that\u2019s more than anywhere else in the world, and to put that figure into context it\u2019s more than Sweden\u2019s annual GDP.",
        "So it\u2019s one thing if over the long term one country locks out its friends to compete with opponents, but it\u2019s another if you\u2019re locking out the investment made by your own companies.",
        "And those same opponents don\u2019t hesitate to use strong arm tactics to create geopolitical divides and to threaten and coerce smaller economies.",
        "So if the US and UK are to future proof ourselves and our allies against a changing world, we need to approach trade in a more muscular way.",
        "As world leading centres for strategic industries, we need to develop trade policy that reflects how global commerce is evolving. And we need to use it to fight even harder for the ideas and values that underpin our democracies and economies.",
        "And we must help each other do that. So that means working together to shape the rules that govern global commerce before those who want to grab control and stifle free trade get there first.",
        "Protecting intellectual property rights is one example. Both our economies were built on the work of inventors and entrepreneurs.",
        "And intellectual property rights drive the innovation, they incentivise inventors, they protect and reward their ideas. And if we conflate these ideas of Intellectual Property with protectionism, we risk choking off innovation.",
        "So, it\u2019s important that the UK and US work together to champion the multilateral rules-based system, uphold the international Intellectual Property rights framework \u2013 and with every trade barrier that falls and every contract that gets signed between businesses, opportunity and prosperity increases around the world. This means democracy flourishes and the case for autocracy diminishes.",
        "There is an exciting future ahead for us both in terms of UK-US trade cooperation. I\u2019m thrilled to be part of that and to be working with you here in Washington and also across the US.",
        "And I look forward to a shared transatlantic future filled with even more friendship, economic cooperation and mutual success.",
        "Thank you."
