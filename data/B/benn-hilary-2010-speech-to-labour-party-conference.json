        "Conference,\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to you Michael, the members of the Policy Commission, and to the ministerial team who served in Defra \u2013 Jim, Huw, Dan, and Bryan \u2013 and Joyce, John and Emma who have joined us since May for everything you\u2019ve done.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "As Ed said on Tuesday politics is about our values. It\u2019s about wanting to change things for the better. About what we do when we have the chance.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "The financial crisis taught us a painful lesson. Take things for granted. Get things out of balance, and they become unsustainable.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Conference, we cannot \u2013 we must not \u2013 le t the same thing happen to our planet.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",

        "Now some will say \u2018it\u2019s too difficult\u2019. Others will say \u2018now is not the time\u2019.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "We must reply with confidence that we\u2019ve faced big challenges before.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Our party was founded by the trade unions because the biggest challenge of that age was for us to make the economy \u2013 to make life \u2013 fair for working people.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "From that single powerful idea was born a movement \u2013 a movement to protect workers in the mills and factories, to give every child the chance to go to school, to win the right to free medical care when we are ill, and to end the scandal of \u00a31.50 an hour jobs by bringing in a minimum wage.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Yes there\u2019s more to do, but let\u2019s celebrate how our politics changed people\u2019s lives for the better.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "This century\u2019s challenge \u2013 however \u2013 is a different one. How do we sustain a strong and successful and fair economy on our small and fragile planet when the world\u2019s climate is changing?\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Where resources \u2013 oil and water \u2013 are becoming scarce.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",

        "Where poverty and inequality and disease still scar the lives of many.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "The big question of our age is how do we make our planet fair.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",

        "Every one of these was once just a dream, but it was our values and our politics that made them happen.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "It was a Labour Government that made them happen.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "What a contrast with the Coalition Government.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "David Cameron tells us we are all in this together. Really? If that\u2019s so, then why are you determined to abolish the Agricultural Wages Board. For 70 years it has ensured a fair deal and fair pay for farm workers, overtime rates, standby allowances, bereavement leave.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Even Mrs Thatcher did not dare do this.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "All in this together, Mr Cameron ? No. This is a shabby little plan and we will oppose it every step of the way.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "A government that says it is compassionate. Really? It wants to bring back the barbarous spectacle of fox and stag hunting, and hare coursing to our countryside. Mr Cameron, this isn\u2019t compassion. It\u2019s animal cruelty and we will oppose it every step of the way.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "A government that claims to be the greenest ever but is undermining confidence in feed-in tariffs, dithering on the renewable heat incentive, says it\u2019s alright to go on throwing waste into landfill when it could be recycled, reducing funding for our national parks, abolishing the Sustainable Development Commission, and is about to unveil cuts that will surely affect farming and the natural world.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Cuts that will affect the lives of our children and our grandchildren.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "For what does the natural environment give us?\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Clean water. Clean air. Food. Fuel. Plants for medicines. But once we start to lose plants or species, they can disappear for ever and no amount of money can bring them back.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "That\u2019s why we must protect them every step of the way.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Greenest Government ever, Mr Cameron? No. That\u2019s just empty words from a government devoid of optimism.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And why do we need optimism?\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Because what we do about climate chang e and about the loss of forests and habitats is not only about protecting nature\u2019s capacity to inspire and to lift our spirits.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "It is also about the biggest \u2013 and oldest \u2013 cause of all.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",

        "From the melting of the ice sheets to crops ravaged by disease.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "From the erosion of soil to the felling of forests that takes from people their food, their fire wood and the chance to shelter from the heat of the mid-day sun.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "It\u2019s why we need a climate deal in Cancun.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "It\u2019s why we need to invest in renewables.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "It\u2019s why we need to put down our axes and pick up our shovels to plants saplings and grow trees.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And we will not be immune either.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Remember the heatwave in Europe seven years ago. It killed thousands.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Remember the flooding in Hull, Sheffield, Tewksbury and Cockermouth.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Imagine what rising sea levels would do to our coastal towns and communities.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Conference \u2013 the earth is trying to tell us something and our future existence depends on us using its gifts in a way that can be sustained in the years and centuries ahead.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",

        "And this change will require purpose, determination and, yes, optimism.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "That\u2019s how we secured our greatest achievements as a Party and that\u2019s how we will do so again.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And that\u2019s exactly what Sadiq and I saw last week at the Olympic Park in East London.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",

        "Green spaces for all to enjoy.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "A community transformed, and an infectious sense of enthusiasm.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",

        "A future not of hairshirts and backward glances.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "But a future of possibilities, where by using technology, design, imagination, passion, commitment \u2013 and all the skills of all the people \u2013 we can build a new Jerusalem of green and pleasant lands.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
