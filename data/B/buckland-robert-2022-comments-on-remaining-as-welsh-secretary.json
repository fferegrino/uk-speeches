        "Working alongside our new Prime Minister, fellow Cabinet Ministers and colleagues in Wales, I\u2019m looking forward to delivering for all parts of our great country.",
        "The cost of living and increasing energy bills are having a significant impact on every single person in the country, and it\u2019s a priority for me to make sure that families, businesses and individuals across Wales receive all possible help to see us through this challenging winter.",
        "Wales has a huge part to play in our longer-term energy needs with potential for offshore wind, nuclear and renewable energy schemes. These are projects that create jobs and prosperity, help secure our energy future and deliver our Net Zero targets.",
