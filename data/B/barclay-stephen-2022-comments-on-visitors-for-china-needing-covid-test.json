        "As Covid cases in China rise ahead of them reopening their borders next week, it is right for us to take a balanced and precautionary approach by announcing these temporary measures while we assess the data.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "This allows our world leading scientists at the UK Health Security Agency to gain rapid insight into potential new variants circulating in China.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "The best defence against the virus, however, remains the vaccine. NHS staff have done an incredible job delivering over 150 million jabs across the UK.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "It isn\u2019t too late to come forward, for your first, second, third, or autumn booster \u2013 it\u2019s quick and easy and you can book online, on the NHS app, or just turn up at one of the many walk-in centres across the UK.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body"
