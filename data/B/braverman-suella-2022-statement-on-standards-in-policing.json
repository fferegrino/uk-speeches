    "summary": "The statement made by Suella Braverman, the Home Secretary, on 17 October 2022.",
    "content": [
        "The public rightly expects the highest standards of behaviour from police officers and the vast majority meet this expectation.",
        "But recently too many high-profile incidents and reports, especially in London, have damaged trust.",
        "This cannot continue.",
        "It\u2019s unfair on the public and lets down other serving officers.",
        "Culture and standards in the police must improve.",
        "And where an officer has fallen seriously short of these expectations, demonstrable, public action must be taken.",
        "It\u2019s absolutely vital that the police act to restore trust, return to common sense policing and treat the public and victims with the respect they deserve.",
        "I welcome the Met Police\u2019s commitment to tackling the issues raised in the Baroness Casey report and hope this review will also help to address underlying concerns."
