        "As Britain\u2019s Jewish community joins Jews all over the world in celebrating Hanukah I wanted to pass on my own warm wishes for this festival of lights. As you gather round the menorah, may you draw strength from the Hanukah story of how light and faith can endure the toughest of times.",
