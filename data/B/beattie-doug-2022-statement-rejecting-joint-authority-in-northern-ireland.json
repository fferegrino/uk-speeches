    "summary": "The statement made by Doug Beattie, the Leader of the Ulster Unionists, on 26 October 2022.",
    "content": [
        "The Ulster Unionist Party has already very firmly rejected the notion of Joint Authority between London and Dublin in Northern Ireland.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "As Unionists we are clear that only the United Kingdom has the right to exercise sovereignty over Northern Ireland.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "We would advise anyone seeking the imposition of Joint Authority to read the Belfast Agreement, especially the section \u2018Constitutional Issues\u2019 where it states that \u2018it would be wrong to make any change in the status of Northern Ireland save with the consent of a majority of its people.\u2019\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Joint Authority would clearly be a massive change in our constitutional status.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "The Belfast Agreement has already been damaged by the NI Protocol and the imposition of a border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. Clearly any attempt to impose some form of Joint Authority between London and Dublin on Northern Ireland would run contrary to that, breach the Principle of Consent and deal a fatal blow to the Belfast Agreement.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "We need to focus our efforts on getting Stormont back up and running again and working the Belfast Agreement. That is what Northern Ireland needs right now.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body"
