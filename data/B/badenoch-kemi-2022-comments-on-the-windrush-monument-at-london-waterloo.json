        "This is a special moment in our nation\u2019s history and I am grateful to all those who worked tirelessly to bring it into being.",
        "Basil Watson\u2019s sculpture perfectly captures the spirit of Windrush. In it we see the strength, hope and expectation of those who arrived with little and yet gave so much.",
        "As a first-generation immigrant myself, the Windrush story resonates with me and it is important we recognise the contribution of those who have so enriched our country."
