        "On a point of order, Mr Speaker. As you will know, during the evacuation from Afghanistan many hon. Members were concerned about constituents who had loved ones stuck in Afghanistan. One issue that arose was how it came to be that Pen Farthing and Nowzad were allowed to evacuate animals while there were still people stuck in Afghanistan.",
        "The Prime Minister said on 26 August that he had \u201cno influence\u201d on that particular case and nor would it be right. On 7 December, he was asked \u201cDid you intervene to get Pen Farthing\u2019s animals out?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, that is complete nonsense.\u201d And the Downing Street spokesperson said, \u201cNeither the Prime Minister nor Mrs Johnson was involved.\u201c Yet today, as I think you are aware, Mr Speaker, the Foreign Affairs Committee has published a letter from Lord Goldsmith\u2019s office saying,",
        "\u201cthe PM has just authorised their staff and animals to be evacuated\u201d.",
