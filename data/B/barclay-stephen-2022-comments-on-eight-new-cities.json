        "I am delighted that a record number of locations have been awarded the prestigious city status as part of Her Majesty The Queen\u2019s Platinum Jubilee Celebrations.",
        "What was clear to me during the process of assessing each application was the pride that people felt for their communities, local cultural heritage and the Royal Family.",
        "As we celebrate Her Majesty The Queen\u2019s colossal contribution to society, I am thrilled that we are able to recognise some of the many places that make Britain great.",
        "It is also incredibly reflective of Her Majesty\u2019s global outlook and years of international service that applicants from the Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies have been selected as winners for the first time.",
        "I look forward to the world coming together to show our pride and gratitude to Queen Elizabeth II on the Jubilee weekend.",
        "**[The settlements given city status were:**",
        "**Bangor, Northern Ireland**  \n**Colchester, England**  \n**Doncaster, England**  \n**Douglas, Isle of Man**  \n**Dunfermline, Scotland**  \n**Milton Keynes, England**  \n**Stanley, Falkland Islands**  \n**Wrexham, Wales]**"
