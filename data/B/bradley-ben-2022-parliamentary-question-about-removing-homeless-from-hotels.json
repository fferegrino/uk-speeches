    "content": [
        "**Ben Bradley (Mansfield) (Con)**",
        "This weekend, a new migrant hotel was set up in my constituency. I was contacted on Sunday and told that it would be happening\u2014future tense. I subsequently found out that it had actually happened already, on Saturday. As yet\u2014it is now Wednesday\u2014we still have no details on who, how long and what is in place around that facility. On Monday morning, several local people presented themselves as homeless, having been kicked out of the same hotel, which was previously used by the local authority as temporary accommodation. My right hon. Friend must surely agree that this is wrong and untenable, and will cause a huge amount of anger locally. The Government need to stop this\u2014he knows that\u2014but can he, at the very least, ensure that, after this urgent question, he is able to investigate in his Department to ensure that local stakeholders and councils are able to get the information they need urgently to put the support in place that they need at local level?",
        "**Robert Jenrick**",
        "I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I believe my officials have already reached out to his council to provide it with further information. As I said earlier, this is not the situation that any of us would want to be in. It is the product of record numbers of people crossing the channel and a failure to plan in the months prior to this sudden surge. What we need to do now is move forwards and ensure, as our first duty, that Manston is operating legally and correctly. We must then ensure that any further accommodation is procured in a sensible way\u2014simple and decent accommodation, not luxurious hotels\u2014and that we have proper communication with local authorities. That is my objective and I am very happy to work with him to achieve it."
