        "Innovation is at the heart of our Long-term Economic Plan and the low carbon sector is rich in innovation.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "New low carbon technologies are essential to reduce the cost of energy for hard-pressed consumers, lower overall energy consumption, and help us gain a large piece of the massive global market for LCGES.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "The Coalition recognises the important role innovation will play in the long-term future of the UK economy leading to new technologies, new jobs and new opportunities.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "By targeting our innovation support effectively and fulfilling our innovation goals we could save the UK over \u00a3100bn in cost reductions to 2050.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Targeted innovation in energy efficiency alone could lead to savings worth up to \u00a32,500 for each UK household and business up to 2050.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "That\u2019s enough to build 14,000 community hospitals, over 5,000 new schools or over 130 Olympic stadiums, and generate UK-based business activity contributing tens of billions of pounds to GDP over the same period.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Recognising the huge potential, this Government has taken the decision to invest in supporting businesses and academics to undertake energy innovation, despite the challenging economic climate over the past few years.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "As a result, the UK now has the sixth biggest share of the \u00a33.4 trillion global market for low carbon goods and environmental services. And by driving innovation we are putting in place the right technologies to produce cleaner energy, at an affordable cost to the consumer.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "But before I go any further, let me tell you the 3 key points I would like to make today:\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Firstly, we have worked hard since 2010 to put in place much of the foundations to unlock low carbon innovation and the development of the smarter, more integrated solutions that will be the lifeblood of a future, affordable energy system.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Secondly, the Coalition isn\u2019t just building on the status quo. We are putting in place the first ever Low Carbon Innovation Strategic Framework, providing our vision for low carbon innovation as part of our long-term economic plan.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Thirdly, although there are many terrific technologies I could choose to expand upon today, I want to highlight our commitment to driving one in particular. One that has the potential to play a revolutionary role in our future energy system \u2013 energy storage.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Firstly, this Government is embarking upon the biggest transformation of the UK\u2019s energy system since privatisation.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Over the next 20 to 30 years this will lead to a profound shift from highly centralised fossil fuel burning power plants to a cleaner, low carbon, more distributed, interconnected and smarter energy market.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "No-one knows exactly what the future will look like but it is not too great a stretch of the imagination to picture a population transported by electric vehicles, living in remotely-controlled homes, and generating energy from waste materials which can be fed into a local grid.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Already, thanks to recent innovations, such a vision is less futuristic than one might think.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Newcastle has recently started installing 580 electric vehicle charging points across the region as part of its efforts to become the UK\u2019s electric car capital.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "The UK is leading the way in smart grid development across the EU.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And, overall, since 2012, over 150 entrepreneurial companies have been provided with grants to support the development of innovative, low carbon technologies through DECC\u2019s \u00a3200m innovation programme.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Indeed, I am delighted to see that nine of the 40 companies presenting at this event have been awarded an innovation grant from DECC.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "And over 50 companies have been supported through our broadest innovation programme \u2013 the Energy Entrepreneurs Fund.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
