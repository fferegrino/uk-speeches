        "Conference \u2013",
        "It\u2019s a great honour to make my first conference speech as Shadow Chancellor \u2013 the first ever Labour and Co-operative Shadow Chancellor \u2013 here at our first annual conference in this great city of Liverpool since 1925.",
        "Thank you to Norma for that introduction \u2013 and to all the members of our Policy Commission for their hard work this year.",
        "And I want to say a special thank-you to my co-Chair, Cath Speight, for all her advice and leadership as a member of the NEC for the past 11 years.",
        "Cath \u2013 you are a great servant to your union and to our party and we all thank you.",
        "And Conference, I also want to pay tribute to our leader \u2013 my friend \u2013 Ed Miliband.",
        "On Libya, on phone hacking and on the riots \u2013 he has shown calm, resolute and courageous leadership:",
        "\u2013 not afraid to take on vested interests;",
        "\u2013 passionate that we have responsibility in our society from top to bottom;",
        "\u2013 determined that the promise of Britain \u2013 that the next generation will do better than the last \u2013 can be fulfilled.",
        "In Ed Miliband, conference, we have a leader who is genuine, principled, honest and fair\u2026",
        "\u2026 a leader who speaks his mind and tells the truth\u2026",
        "\u2026 a leader in whom I believe we can ask the British public to put their trust.",
        "**A BETTER WAY?**",
        "And nowhere is it more important that we win the public\u2019s trust for an alternative future \u2013 a better way forward \u2013 than on the economy.",
        "Speaking to one delegate this morning, she said to me:",
        "\u201cpeople are really worried about jobs and the cost of everything going up \u2013 and they\u2019re all saying, \u2018surely there\u2019s a better way?\u2019\u201d",
        "Here in Liverpool, and as a result of the Coalition\u2019s policies, unemployment is now rising again as this city faces the deepest cuts to local services in a generation.",
        "But \u2013 a far cry from the scuttling taxis carrying redundancy notices in the 1980s \u2013 it is a Labour Council here in Liverpool which is working night and day to make savings and cut bureaucracy so they can protect jobs and keep services for the most vulnerable.",
        "And I say to Liverpool\u2019s Labour leader Joe Anderson \u2013 to all our leaders in local government facing difficult times across the UK \u2013 and to First Minister Carwyn Jones in Wales \u2013 we pay tribute to your leadership and responsibility and determination that there can be a better way:",
        "\u2013 yes \u2013 a credible plan to get our deficit down;",
        "\u2013 but action now \u2013 a plan for growth and jobs;",
        "\u2013 and long-term reforms to build a stronger, fairer economy;",
        "A Labour plan to get Britain working again.",
        "**GLOBAL LEADERSHIP**",
        "Conference, let\u2019s face the facts.",
        "These are the darkest, most dangerous times for the global economy in my lifetime.",
        "Our country \u2013 the whole of the world \u2013 is facing a threat that most of us have only ever read about in the history books \u2013 a lost decade of economic stagnation:",
        "\u2013 The aftermath of a worldwide financial and banking crash;",
        "\u2013 Families and businesses fearful about the future, cutting back on spending and investment;",
        "\u2013 Governments all around the world trying to cut spending at the same time;",
        "\u2013 Demand sucked out of the economy;",
        "\u2013 Stock markets tumbling, banks in trouble, economies stalling, unemployment rising \u2013 a vicious circle as slow growth makes it harder to get deficits down;",
        "\u2013 Not a crisis of any one country or continent \u2013 but a spiralling global crisis \u2013 from which no economy can be safe\u2026",
        "\u2026 threatening the jobs, pensions and living standards of families here in Britain and across the world.",
        "Conference \u2013",
        "This is not \u2013 as the Conservatives claim \u2013 simply a crisis of public debt which can be solved \u2013 country by country \u2013 by austerity, cuts and retrenchment \u2013 but truly a global growth crisis which is deepening and becoming more dangerous by the day.",
        "And the world must remember the lesson of the 1930s: that there is no credibility in piling austerity on austerity, tax rise on tax rise, cut upon cut in the eventual hope that it will work when all the evidence is pointing the other way.",
        "I said to you a year ago \u2013 you either learn the lessons of history \u2013 or you repeat the mistakes of history \u2013 that is the choice the world faces today.",
        "But at a time when the world desperately needs a global plan for growth \u2013 when it needs wise and strong leadership \u2013 where will it come from?",
        "Not so far from the Euro zone \u2013 unable to stand together and do what it takes to restore confidence and growth.",
        "Not so far from America \u2013 deadlocked by the reckless games of the Republican right.",
        "And Conference, what about our Prime Minister and Chancellor?",
        "Do they urge a change of course in the Euro zone?",
        "No \u2013 they applaud austerity, and urge even deeper cuts.",
        "Do they urge sanity in America?",
        "No \u2013 George Osborne boasts that his Republican friends in Congress are following his advice.",
        "Do they urge a global growth plan in the G7, the G20 or the IMF?",
        "No.",
        "Confronted with the biggest most urgent global challenge of our age, all they can do is urge other countries to pile austerity on austerity too\u2026 ignoring the lessons of history and the evidence here in Britain, and across the world, that austerity just isn\u2019t working.",
        "That is not just a failure of leadership \u2013 it is a complete abdication of responsibility too.",
        "**A SAFE HAVEN?**",
        "But Conference\u2026",
        "It\u2019s not right to blame David Cameron and George Osborne for everything that\u2019s wrong with our economy.",
        "They didn\u2019t cause the global financial crisis.",
        "That crisis was a body blow to our economy and our public finances \u2013 we went into recession, lost tax revenues, a big deficit opened up.",
        "Whoever won the last election faced a difficult task to secure economic recovery and reduce that deficit over time.",
        "And that task has been made harder by the economic problems in the Euro-zone, America and Japan.",
        "But the simple question that the government has to answer \u2013 the issue on which they can and must be held to account \u2013 is this: have their decisions over the past year and a half made things better or have they made things worse?",
        "A year ago, I warned that, with our economy still fragile and a global hurricane brewing, it was not the time to tear out the foundations of the house.",
        "But David Cameron and George Osborne thought they knew better:",
        "\u2013 They said a VAT rise and cutting faster than any other major country would boost economic confidence and growth;",
        "\u2013 That if they cut public sector jobs, the private sector would more than fill the gap;",
        "\u2013 That their plan would make Britain immune from the global storm \u2013 and any other course of action would cause stock market turmoil\u2026",
        "And to be fair, some respected people agreed with them.",
        "But we in this Party argued for a steadier, more balanced approach \u2013 halving the deficit over four years.",
        "We said that going too far, too fast would choke off the recovery and put jobs at risk;",
        "We warned that cutting spending and raising taxes too fast would create a vicious circle here in Britain too \u2013 and make it harder to get the deficit down.",
        "And look what\u2019s happened \u2013 even before the global instability of the past three months.",
        "Confidence has slumped.",
        "Our economy has flat-lined now for nine months.",
        "Slower growth in Britain than any other G7 country except Japan.",
        "Unemployment now rising again.",
        "That is why the deficit is already set to be \u00a346 billion higher than the government planned.",
        "Because if you choke off the recovery and put tens of thousands of people on the dole \u2013 not paying taxes, claiming benefits instead \u2013 then, of course, borrowing goes up.",
        "In the 1980s, the Tories told us \u2013 shockingly \u2013 that because their economic objective was to reduce inflation, rising unemployment was a price worth paying.",
        "This generation of Tories need to realise if your economic objective is to reduce the deficit, then rising unemployment is one thing you just can\u2019t afford.",
        "**NO ALTERNATIVE?**",
        "So Conference\u2026",
        ".. the global economic crisis is deepening, our economy is badly exposed\u2026",
        "And what do we hear from ministers?",
        "However bad things get\u2026 even when we can all see it\u2019s not working:",
        "\u2018We are sticking to the plan,\u2019 they say",
        "\u2018We are not for turning.\u2019",
        "\u2018There is no alternative.\u2019",
        "\u2018There is no better way.\u2019",
        "They claim that any change of course would lead to a market crisis and higher interest rates.",
        "But our interest rates are at record lows because our economy has stagnated.",
        "Markets are losing confidence in governments all around the world because there is no growth.",
        "And there is a growing chorus of voices calling for a change of course\u2026",
        "Even the IMF now says:",
        "\u201cgrowth is necessary for fiscal credibility\u201d, and\u2026",
        "\u201cslamming on the brakes too quickly will hurt the recovery and worsen job prospects.\u201d",
        "Yes \u2013 a credible economic policy does needs a plan to get the deficit down.",
        "Yes \u2013 a credible economic policy needs political agreement to implement that plan.",
        "But an economic policy can only be credible if it works.",
        "And George Osborne\u2019s economic plan is hurting\u2026 but Conference\u2026 it\u2019s just not working.",
        "**ALL LABOUR\u2019S FAULT?**",
        "But you all heard the chorus from the Lib Dems last week\u2026",
        "You all know what we will hear next week from the Tories\u2026",
        "The only line in the script they\u2019ve got left:",
        "\u2018It\u2019s all Labour\u2019s fault \u2013 we\u2019re just clearing up the mess\u2019.",
        "Conference, we could spend all of our time defending our record\u2026 and there is much to be proud of.",
        "But for families today \u2013 struggling to pay the bills, worrying about their jobs \u2013 being told about the great things Labour did in government isn\u2019t much comfort\u2026 it doesn\u2019t pay the bills, help get a job or secure the pension.",
        "Some commentators say the opposite: accept the Tory critique that Labour spending caused the economic crisis; back Tory policy on the deficit; neutralise the issue and move on.",
        "And when they say we made mistakes in government, they\u2019re right\u2026 we must admit them and show we\u2019ve learned from them.",
        "The 75p pension rise \u2013 that was a mistake.",
        "So was abolishing the 10p tax rate.",
        "We didn\u2019t do enough to get all employers to train.",
        "We should have adopted tougher controls on migration from Eastern Europe.",
        "We didn\u2019t spend every pound of public money well.",
        "And yes \u2013 we didn\u2019t regulate the banks toughly enough and stop their gross irresponsibility \u2013 here in Britain and all around the world.",
        "But don\u2019t let anyone tell you that Labour in government was profligate with public money \u2013 when we went into the crisis with lower national debt than we inherited in 1997 and lower than America, France, Germany and Japan.",
        "And don\u2019t let anyone say it was public spending on public services here in Britain which caused the global financial crisis.",
        "It wasn\u2019t too many police officers or nurses or teachers here in Britain that bankrupted Lehman Brothers in New York.",
        "Conference.",
        "We didn\u2019t get everything right.",
        "We made mistakes.",
        "But abolishing the Future Jobs Fund and cutting 100,000 jobs for young people out of work\u2026 that wasn\u2019t Labour\u2019s mistake.",
        "Scrapping the Regional Development Agencies, ending EMAs, cutting childcare tax credits for working parents\u2026 those aren\u2019t Labour\u2019s mistakes.",
        "Wasting \u00a32bn on a reckless NHS reorganisation\u2026",
        "Wasting \u00a3100m on elected police commissioners\u2026",
        "Wasting 1bn on a tax cut for the banks\u2026",
        "Wasting billions of pounds on the bills of rising unemployment\u2026",
        "Ripping up our balanced plan, trying to cut the deficit faster any other country and choking off the recovery as a result\u2026",
        "Conference\u2026 these aren\u2019t Labour\u2019s mistakes\u2026",
        "They are David Cameron\u2019s mistakes\u2026",
        "And George Osborne\u2019s mistakes\u2026",
        "And Nick Clegg\u2019s mistakes\u2026",
        "Reckless. Ideological. Unfair.",
        "Tory mistakes every one of them.",
        "**A BETTER WAY**",
        "I think of a family I know in my constituency: self-employed \u2013 a husband and wife team \u2013 times are hard at the moment \u2013 but things are still just about ok \u2013 they can pay the mortgage \u2013 they managed a holiday with the kids this year.",
        "But they are worried\u2026",
        "Worried about gas bills, petrol, food all going up\u2026",
        "Worried about losing their tax credits and the child benefit..",
        "Worried when they see other local businesses closing down\u2026",
        "And worried too about the future \u2013 can they keep up their pension payments, can they afford it when their son goes to college.",
        "Better off under Labour \u2013 but it was their hard work which did it.",
        "Deeply aspirational for their kids \u2013 but now very worried about their futures too.",
        "Believe me \u2013 they don\u2019t want to hear about all the things Labour got right.",
        "And believe me \u2013 they certainly do want to know we\u2019ve learned from our mistakes.",
        "But most important\u2026",
        "They want to know that there\u2019s a reason to be hopeful\u2026",
        "That their hard work will be rewarded and their kids will do well\u2026",
        "That there is a better way.",
        "Conference\u2026",
        "Trying to cut the deficit too far, too fast isn\u2019t working.",
        "The government must adopt a steadier, more balanced plan to get our deficit down and take immediate action now to support the economy and create jobs here in Britain.",
        "So here are five immediate steps the government can and should take right now:",
        "Step one \u2013 repeat the bank bonus tax again this year \u2013 and use the money to build 25,000 affordable homes and guarantee a job for 100,000 young people \u2013 it can\u2019t be right to be cutting taxes on the banks when almost 1 in 5 young people are now out of work.",
        "Step two \u2013 genuinely bring forward long-term investment projects \u2013 schools, roads and transport \u2013 to get people back to work and strengthen our economy for the future.",
        "Step three \u2013 reverse January\u2019s damaging VAT rise now for a temporary period \u2013 a \u00a3450 boost for a family with two kids \u2013 immediate help for our high streets and for struggling families and pensioners too.",
        "Step four \u2013 announce an immediate one year cut in VAT to 5% on home improvements, repairs and maintenance \u2013 to help homeowners and the many small businesses that are so dependent on the state of the housing market.",
        "Step five \u2013 a one year national insurance tax break for every small firm which takes on extra workers, using the money left over from the government\u2019s failed national insurance rebate for new businesses \u2013 helping small businesses to grow and create jobs.",
        "Conference\u2026 a plan to help struggling families and small businesses, get our economy growing and create jobs which are the key to getting our deficit down.",
        "Action on jobs;",
        "Investment brought forward;",
        "Support for families;",
        "Support for homeowners;",
        "Support for small businesses.",
        "Five immediate steps the government could take tomorrow \u2013 and if they do so, we will back them.",
        "Call it Plan A plus",
        "Call it Plan B",
        "Call it Plan C",
        "I don\u2019t care what they call it.",
        "Britain just needs a plan that works.",
        "**TOUGH DECISIONS**",
        "But I have to level with you all \u2013 and the country\u2026 a plan for growth now will help get the economy moving again and stop the vicious circle on the deficit \u2013 but by itself it won\u2019t secure our economic future or magic the deficit away.",
        "A steadier, more balanced, medium-term plan to get the deficit down will still mean difficult decisions and tough choices in the years ahead that any government will face.",
        "Tough choices on tax and spending \u2013 like the cuts to welfare, education and Home Office budgets that we set out before the election.",
        "Discipline in public and private sector pay.",
        "And no matter how much we dislike particular Tory spending cuts or tax rises, we cannot make promises now to reverse them.",
        "I won\u2019t do that and neither will any of my Shadow Cabinet colleagues.",
        "And while we know that the Government\u2019s approach to pensions has been confrontational and unfair\u2026",
        "That there is nothing George Osborne would like better than a strike this autumn to divert attention from his failing economic plan\u2026",
        "\u2026 we know too that there are difficult decisions on pensions which we cannot duck and that under Labour contributions and the retirement age would be rising too.",
        "Conference \u2013 it will not be enough to expose that David Cameron and George Osborne have got the economy badly wrong.",
        "We still know today what we recognised seventeen years ago: we will never have credibility unless we have the discipline and the strength to take tough decisions.",
        "When I left the Financial Times to work for Labour in 1994, it was because I knew that a reputation for credibility and a platform of stability were the essential pre-conditions for achieving our wider goals, and I wanted to play my part.",
        "And Conference\u2026",
        "\u2013 Bank of England independence;",
        "\u2013 not joining the Euro;",
        "\u2013 levelling with the public that saving the NHS needed a tax rise;",
        "\u2013 using all the \u00a322bn windfall from the 3G mobile phone auction to repay the national debt \u2013 despite Tory demands to spend it at the time;",
        "\u2026 the same iron discipline that guided those decisions must guide a future Labour government too.",
        "And let me say these two things today.",
        "First, before the next election \u2013 and based on the circumstances we face \u2013 we will set out for our manifesto tough fiscal rules that the next Labour government will have to stick to \u2013 to get out country\u2019s current budget back to balance and national debt on a downward path.",
        "And these fiscal rules will be independently monitored by the Office for Budget Responsibility.",
        "And second we know that, even as bank shares are falling again, David Cameron and Nick Clegg are still betting on a windfall gain from privatising RBS and Lloyds to pay for a pre-election giveaway.",
        "We could also pledge to spend that windfall.",
        "But \u2013 just as with the 3G mobile phone auction \u2013 we will commit instead in our manifesto to do the responsible thing and use any windfall gain from the sale of bank shares to repay the national debt.",
        "Conference that will be Labour\u2019s choice \u2013 fiscal responsibility in the national interest.",
        "**SECURING OUR LONG-TERM ECONOMIC FUTURE**",
        "And on that platform of fiscal responsibility and action now for jobs and growth, we must also build the long-term future of the British economy.",
        "And that means government must act to ensure markets work in the public interest and tackle unfair concentrations of power.",
        "Many of us have had enough experience of government to know that the public sector can fail too:",
        "\u2013 that Whitehall doesn\u2019t always know best;",
        "\u2013 that well-meaning business regulations designed by public servants can sometimes do more harm than good in the real world;",
        "\u2013 that central directions shouted ever more loudly are no substitute for proper public service reforms that get incentives right, tackle market failure and put power in the hands of users.",
        "But we know too that government just walking away is not the answer\u2026",
        "That government has a vital role to play, working closely with business, in making our economy stronger and more balanced for the long-term.",
        "John Denham, Liam Byrne, Angela Eagle and I are working on our new financial, industrial and employment policies.",
        "We can\u2019t claim we have all the answers at this stage.",
        "But we know we can\u2019t tackle our skills deficit unless both government and employers do more.",
        "We can\u2019t have a modern industrial policy without government action:",
        "\u2013 to support new manufacturing technologies, including green manufacturing;",
        "\u2013 to make the planning system work to support investment and jobs;",
        "\u2013 and yes, to ensure a genuinely level playing field for procurement too.",
        "And we can\u2019t tackle the debilitating short-termism which still plagues the relationship between finance and industry in Britain without radical reforms\u2026 reforms that must go beyond the tough regulation of the banks that the Vickers Commission has proposed.",
        "That is why Ed Miliband, John Denham and I are determined that Labour will lead a debate on how to tackle short-termism in our economy\u2026 including tackling market failures in small business lending\u2026 and that means we must now examine proposals for a National Investment Bank for small business.",
        "**CONCLUSION**",
        "Conference, these are vital reforms.",
        "Reforms upon which the future of our country depends.",
        "But they are reforms which this Government just cannot deliver.",
