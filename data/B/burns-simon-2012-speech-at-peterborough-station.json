    "content": [
        "Thank you for that introduction.",
        "And thank you also for asking me along. It\u2019s a genuine pleasure to be here today.",
        "When my officials first asked me if I was interested in a makeover, I thought they meant for me.",
        "Fortunately for my self-esteem the officials in my private office eventually put me straight.",
        "The makeover is right here at Peterborough Station.",
        "And, looking around, I can see that every penny of that \u00a33 million was well spent.",
        "**A makeover that really delivers**",
        "There\u2019s a new station front, a bigger main concourse and a much brighter interior.",
        "There\u2019s a new information point, as well as a new customer waiting area.",
        "People using the station will feel safer and more secure thanks to improved CCTV coverage.",
        "Automated ticket machines mean less hassle and more convenience for passengers.",
        "And, talking of convenience, even the toilets have been refurbished. Looked at from any angle, this is a makeover that really delivers.",
        "And I\u2019m pleased to say it doesn\u2019t stop there. Because I understand there\u2019s more to come.",
        "There will be new lifts and footbridges, as well extra and longer platforms.",
        "And all the work is due to be completed by the end of next year.",
        "**Bigger picture**",
        "But of course, the passenger friendly changes we see here are part of a much bigger picture.",
        "Because we\u2019re actually engaged in a massive rail modernisation effort:",
        "\u2013 new services and extra carriages",
        "\u2013 more seats and faster journeys",
        "\u2013 transforming conventional rail and backing rail high speed rail",
        "From massive, multi-billion pound projects like Crossrail, to smaller multi-million pound projects like Peterborough, we\u2019re renewing and rebuilding Britain\u2019s railways and making them truly fit for the 21st century.",
        "**Team effort**",
        "Now, I know that it takes a real team effort to pull off something like this \u2013 from back office to building site, from accountants to architects.",
        "So, as far as I\u2019m concerned, it doesn\u2019t matter if you were sat in front of a computer or you wore a hard hat, or whether you\u2019re from Network Rail or part of East Coast.",
        "If you were involved in modernising this station then you should feel very proud of yourselves.",
        "And that\u2019s why I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to applaud you for an absolutely fantastic job.",
        "Common interests and a common purpose\u2026.coming together and working together to achieve this station improving, passenger friendly end result.",
        "So a big thank-you for all of your hard graft.",
        "**Concluding remarks \u2013 cutting ribbon/plaque unveiling**",
        "Okay. In my experience \u201cI wish they\u2019d gone on longer\u201d is rarely a tribute paid to a public speaker, especially a politician.",
        "So, without any further ado, it\u2019s an honour and a privilege to declare this station open."
