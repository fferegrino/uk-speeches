        "Conference, there are over 79,000 social workers in our country today.",
        "Doing a job which can be tough and sometimes dangerous \u2013 but which saves lives and makes a huge difference to thousands of families.",
        "And unlike teachers or nurses, fire fighters and police officers where we can celebrate a life saved, a crime solved or a schools exam results, we rarely get the chance to celebrate the quiet successes of our social workers.",
        "It is the toughest job.",
        "And it has been a really difficult year.",
        "The tragic death of Baby Peter in Haringey shocked the nation.",
        "People were appalled by what happened \u2013 by the cruelty he suffered, but also by the collective failure of services in Haringey to keep him safe.",
        "And I had to take tough action \u2013 to restore public confidence and to strengthen frontline practice.",
        "Faced with the same circumstances, I would take the same decisions again.",
        "But I know too that there is no more important job in our country than the job our social workers do day in day out:",
        "Keeping children safe.",
        "Looking after children in care.",
        "Supporting the most vulnerable in our society.",
        "That\u2019s why I am determined to do whatever it takes to get social workers the training, the IT, the support they need to do their job.",
        "And it is also why I am asking you today:",
        "\u2013 to stand up for social workers;",
        "\u2013 to back our Help Give Them a Voice campaign;",
        "\u2013 and to join me in saying \u2013 for their dedication and their professionalism \u2013 thank you to the social workers of our country.",
        "And Conference, what is it that brings people into social work?",
        "What inspires Kevin and Colin, Sharon, Pauline and Colleen \u2013 the brilliant public servants we have applauded this afternoon?",
        "We know the answer.",
        "We have just seen it on this stage.",
        "It is the moral cause of public service.",
        "And Conference, this is our moral cause too.",
        "It is this commitment to social justice which brought many of us here today into politics:",
        "\u2013 that every child should have the right to be safe and happy and the opportunity to make the most of their talents;",
        "\u2013 and that there should be no barrier too great to overcome \u2013 not where they live, their parents\u2019 income, their special need or disability,",
        "No barrier too great to overcome if through our collective endeavour we can break down those barriers and give every child the opportunities they deserve.",
        "That is the vision of our Children\u2019s Plan.",
        "That is what we mean by social justice.",
        "And we can be proud of our work together to turn our moral purpose into direct action.",
        "Think of it \u2013 in 1997 \u2013 no Children\u2019s Centres at all \u2013 or free nursery care.",
        "But as Yvette and I know \u2013 as many of you know all too well \u2013 it is hard to balance work and family life and we all want our children to have the best start in life:",
        "\u2013 that is why Mums and Dads can now get the financial support they need to stay at home with their children after they are born;",
        "\u2013 a free nursery place for all 3 and 4 year olds, now being extended to 250,000 2 year olds;",
        "\u2013 thousands of families with a disabled child now getting the short breaks they desperately need \u2013 and parents whose relationships are under pressure, getting help too;",
        "and by March next year, 3,500 Sure Start Children\u2019s Centres \u2013 one in every community.",
        "A new and universal pillar of our welfare state delivered by this Labour government.",
        "And in 1997 our country had one of the lowest rates of staying on at 16.",
        "But because we are determined to give all young people the chance to succeed we now have 225,000 young people starting apprenticeships this year.",
        "We\u2019re guaranteeing a place in sixth form, college or training for every school leaver this September.",
        "And we have also legislated so that for the first time in our country\u2019s history, education will be a right for every young person until the age of 18.",
        "For our Labour, trade union and co-operative movement a dream for 100 years and more \u2013 now delivered in this century by this Labour government.",
        "And Conference, remember what we campaigned to change twelve years ago:",
        "\u2013 leaking roofs and freezing classrooms;",
        "\u2013 photocopied textbooks;",
        "\u2013 a teaching profession demoralised;",
        "\u2013 over half of schools not making the grade.",
        "That was Tory education policy.",
        "And where are we now?",
        "4,000 new or refurbished schools \u2013 the biggest school building programme since the Victorian era;",
        "funding per pupil more than doubled;",
        "42,000 more teachers \u2013 the best paid in our history \u2013 and 183,000 teaching assistants too;",
        "and not half of schools but less than 1 in 10 secondary schools now below our National Challenge standard.",
        "That is the difference made by a Labour government \u2013 our moral purpose in action.",
        "Of course, not everyone agrees.",
        "Michael Gove says our state schools are failing.",
        "He wrongly claims that grades are rising because exams are getting easier.",
        "Michael: stop running down the real achievements of our young people and the hard work of teachers in schools round the country.",
        "And conference, unlike the Tories, we will not break our promises on pay and conditions to teachers and head teachers.",
        "We will put teaching on the same professional footing as doctors and lawyers, introduce an entitlement to continuous professional development and reduce workload so teachers can get on and teach.",
        "And we can only do this by protecting the vital role our teaching assistants play every day \u2013 and our caretakers, cooks and cleaners too.",
        "That is why I am backing our support staff negotiating body today with new funding so that we can raise the training and recognition of support staff across our country.",
        "And I want to pay particular tribute to the hard work of our school catering staff \u2013 it because of their efforts and the campaigning of the National Policy Forum, the GMB, Unison and Party members that this month we started our pilots in Newham and County Durham \u2013 free school meals for all their primary school children.",
        "And Conference, we know too that our teachers play a hugely important and trusted role in our communities and with our children.",
        "I say there is no place in a civilised society for bullying of any kind whether because of race, or disability or sexual orientation.",
        "And I say too there is no place for racism of any kind in our schools.",
        "That is why I am today asking the former Chief Inspector of Schools, Maurice Smith, to examine the evidence and make recommendations.",
        "I want us to be confident that we have all the powers we need to keep racism and BNP activity out of all our schools.",
        "Conference.",
        "I want to say thank you to Cath Speight and the Policy Commission for their debates and advice.",
        "And to our brilliant ministerial team, Dawn and Vernon, Kevin, Diana, Delyth and Iain.",
        "We all know we still have much more to do to break down every barrier so that every child can succeed.",
        "That is why we are uncompromising about raising standards in every school \u2013 with schools working together in National Challenge Trusts, Co-op trusts, and our Academies programme to break the historic link between poverty and attainment.",
        "And when children fall behind they need extra help to get back on track \u2013 so we will guarantee one to one tuition in primary and secondary schools with extra help and support for children with special educational needs",
        "And because parents do want to know how their children and local schools are doing \u2013 we will keep tests at the end of Year 6, but we will introduce a new Report Card so that schools are, for the first time, fairly judged on all they do and parents get all the information they need.",
        "But parents also want their children to go to an orderly school with a strong head teacher who won\u2019t tolerate bullying or disruptive behaviour in the classroom \u2013 like Blatchington Mill School in Hove which I visited this morning with the Prime Minister.",
        "So the Schools Minister Vernon Coaker and I are today announcing our new Behaviour Challenge so that every school has good discipline.",
        "And we will back head teachers, and expect all parents to back teachers too, so they have the confidence to use their powers to the full so teachers can teach and all children can learn.",
        "But Conference we will have to meet our goals in tougher times.",
        "It\u2019s been a turbulent twelve months \u2013 the worst global financial crisis for a very long time.",
        "Who can now doubt that the swift and decisive leadership of Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling saved Britain \u2013 and the world \u2013 from sliding into depression?",
        "And we will not shirk the tough decisions to deliver the recovery we need and to get the deficit down.",
        "On tax, those with the broadest shoulders are carrying a heavier burden.",
        "And on spending too, we will make efficiency savings and ensure value for money.",
        "That is the only fair way to protect our frontline priorities.",
        "So let us say loud and clear today:",
        "We are not going to cut back Sure Start or tax credits or threaten child benefit.",
        "That\u2019s David Cameron\u2019s plan.",
        "And we will not deny school leavers the college and apprenticeship places they need or cut our school building programme to pay for an unfair and unfunded free market education experiment.",
        "That\u2019s Michael Gove\u2019s plan.",
        "But you know what shocked me most this summer?",
        "It wasn\u2019t Michael Gove agreeing with George Osborne to cut schools and Sure Start budgets.",
        "It wasn\u2019t Michael Gove running down the achievements of our young people.",
        "It wasn\u2019t his refusal to back our free school meals pilots.",
        "None of that surprised me.",
        "After all, he is a Tory.",
        "But when he said we should exclude all vocational qualifications and Diplomas from league table comparisons of school performance, you start to get the real measure of his plans.",
        "Time after time I\u2019ve visited schools where heads have proudly shown me design or construction, sport or dance lessons and told me those subjects have inspired young people to get good grades, including in maths and English too.",
        "But Michael Gove says that these are soft subjects which should not count.",
        "What schools does he visit?",
        "How can he say all the pupils in our state schools learning these vocational subjects are second class?",
        "Instead of ending the damaging old divide between first class academic qualifications for some and vocational learning for the rest, he wants turn to back the clock and entrench that divide.",
        "Conference \u2013 this is the choice.",
        "Between a Conservative Party determined to preserve excellence for those who have it and a Labour government committed to open up excellence and opportunity for all.",
        "So I tell you:",
        "\u2013 we are not going to cut investment in schools and Sure Start;",
        "\u2013 we are not going to mandate cuts to frontline services that mean fewer teachers and teaching assistants;",
        "\u2013 we are not going to pay for an inheritance tax cut for the wealthy few by cutting investment in our children\u2019s future;",
        "That is the Tory way \u2013 and we will fight it from now until election day.",
        "Conference, we know the truth.",
        "When public services are scaled back, we know which communities lose out.",
        "When unemployment becomes entrenched, we know which constituencies suffer most.",
        "When only some children succeed, we know which children will be left behind.",
        "And the reason why our Party campaigned so hard to be elected in 1945 and 1964 and 1997 was because we had seen the reality of Tory government.",
        "Our predecessors saw their communities ravaged by the mass unemployment of the \u201830s.",
        "They saw millions of young people excluded from the chance of a university place in the \u201850s.",
        "And then many of us lived through the 18 years of Thatcher and Major governments and saw:",
        "\u2013 child poverty doubling;",
        "\u2013 youth unemployment soaring;",
        "\u2013 public services slashed to the bone.",
        "I say to anyone who doubts whether this is a fight worth fighting,",
        "Let us not learn that lesson the hard way again.",
        "We don\u2019t need to go back to Opposition to remind us why we need a Labour government.",
        "There is only one party that can get us through this downturn and that\u2019s our Party \u2013 the Labour party",
        "There is only one party that will prioritise investment in education for all and that\u2019s our party \u2013 the Labour party.",
        "There is only movement whose commitment to social justice is so deep in its core that \u2013 even in difficult times \u2013 we will still invest in our NHS and to support our pensioners and to tackle child poverty.",
        "It is going to be a hard fight. Yes\u2026we are the underdogs.",
        "But in the coming months as we make the phone calls, deliver the leaflets and knock on doors, remember what\u2019s at stake:",
        "\u2013 3,500 Children\u2019s Centres \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s at stake.",
        "\u2013 over 2 million children still living in poverty \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s at stake.",
        "\u2013 our plan to rebuild or refurbish every secondary school \u2013 that\u2019s what at stake.",
        "\u2013 education to 18 a right for every young person \u2013 the future of our country \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s at stake.",
        "This is the most important election for a generation.",
        "We must rise to the challenge.",
        "It will be the fight of our lives \u2013 let us go and win it."
