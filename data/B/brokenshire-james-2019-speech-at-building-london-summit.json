        "**Introduction**",
        "Thanks, John [Dickie], it\u2019s great to be here.",
        "As a London MP, I know just how vital the capital\u2019s businesses and the talented, dedicated people who lead them, work in them and support them are to our country\u2019s prosperity.",
        "And I want to thank you for helping make London the global beacon for creativity, diversity and enterprise that it is.",
        "To be a Londoner, born or adopted, is a badge of pride and testament to this great city\u2019s ability to embrace opportunities and challenges like no other.",
        "As such, I know that our capital \u2013 and, by extension, our country \u2013 is well\u2013placed to seize the opportunities that lie ahead.",
        "But of course, I recognise that also means delivering economic certainty and stability, that means delivering a Brexit deal in the best interests of our economy, and the best interests of our country.",
        "Last night\u2019s vote in the House of Commons showed that Parliament does not want to leave the EU without a withdrawal agreement and future framework.",
        "The government will now redouble it\u2019s efforts to secure arrangements which will do just that, and secure a deal that Parliament can support and deliver on the vote of the British people in the referendum and get on with delivering our vision of building a country that works for everyone.",
        "That very much means building the homes our country needs and that is central to that ambition, and indeed what today\u2019s event is all about.",
        "There are few places in our country where this need is more acute \u2013 where the gap between demand and supply, between what people can afford and what\u2019s on offer, is more stark.",
        "This isn\u2019t just a top priority for Londoners.",
        "As the Prime Minister has said, it\u2019s a top priority for our country.",
        "We\u2019ve made some important progress.",
        "Last year, we delivered the highest number of new homes in a decade \u2013 222,000 \u2013 up 2% on the previous year.",
        "And just a fortnight ago, we learned that the number of new homes being built had hit the highest level for a decade \u2013 up 12% on the previous year.",
        "This is positive news.",
        "And I want to pay tribute to everyone here today for your contribution to this.",
        "In all, since 2010, this government has delivered over one million new homes and we\u2019re determined to get that up to 300,000 homes a year by the middle of the next decade.",
        "London will be key to achieving that goal.",
        "Which is why it was disappointing to see that net additions in London were down by almost 20% last year, with 21 boroughs showing a dip in their annual supply.",
        "So, there\u2019s no question that we need to raise our game urgently \u2013 to seize every opportunity to boost supply across the capital and key transport corridors and deliver for the Londoners who just want a place to call home.",
        "The government is playing its part.",
        "We\u2019re putting billions into housing and infrastructure \u2013 at least \u00a344 billion of financial support over 5 years.",
        "We\u2019re reforming planning to provide greater certainty and clarity for developers and communities and have empowered Homes England, our new national housing agency, to take a more strategic and assertive approach to increasing supply around and outside London.",
        "We\u2019ve also removed the government cap on how much councils can borrow to build more \u2013 a real breakthrough \u2013 and are investing \u00a32 billion of long\u2013term funding to help housing associations deliver.",
        "And I\u2019m delighted to announce today that we\u2019ll be making \u00a3497 million available to housing associations to help build 11,000 new affordable homes, including properties for social rent.",
        "These strategic partnerships \u2013 agreed by Homes England \u2013 will give associations from Essex to Ecclestone the freedom to spend this money where it will have the biggest impact.",
        "Taking us a step closer to meeting our ambition of delivering 300,000 homes a year.",
        "But this isn\u2019t just about getting the numbers up.",
        "It\u2019s also about putting fairness at the heart of the housing market \u2013 by restoring the dream of home ownership and championing renters through our new \u00a37.2 billion Help to Buy scheme to 2023 and initiatives like Build to Rent.",
        "And by taking action to end rough sleeping for good and implementing a new regulatory framework for building safety following the tragedy at Grenfell Tower \u2013 ensuring we deliver for all parts of our society.",
        "London stands to benefit hugely from these measures \u2013 particularly the removal of the removal of the borrowing cap which could unlock around 10,000 homes \u2013 and which many in the sector have been calling for for some time.",
        "It\u2019s been great to see how warmly this has been welcomed by councils in London and elsewhere \u2013 and how ambitious they are about making the most of this opportunity to deliver the next generation of council housing.",
        "It\u2019s notable, too, that the capital has received around half of the national funding pot for the Affordable Homes Programme in recent years and we\u2019re providing \u00a3486 million to the Greater London Authority to help deliver 3 of our new funds: Accelerated Construction, Land Assembly and Small Sites.",
        "Funds that, together, will help generate over 8,000 new homes by unlocking land, delivering homes more quickly and diversifying the house building market.",
        "On top of this, there\u2019s the Budget announcement that the first successful Housing Infrastructure Fund Forward Funding Bid would be in London.",
        "This amounts to \u00a3291 million of grant funding for vital infrastructure on the Docklands Light Railway, which will ease pressure on existing services in the area and unlock up to 18,000 homes across East London.",
        "We\u2019re also investing in skills through, for example, a \u00a324 million Construction Skills Fund that will see 7 housing sites in London benefit from on-site construction training hubs.",
        "And, crucially, we\u2019re backing innovation in housebuilding such as Modern Methods of Construction.",
        "I want to see the sector really embracing this more innovative approach over the coming months to build faster, improve productivity and drive up choice and quality for people in and outside the capital.",
        "Which is why I\u2019m delighted to be announcing today that Homes England will be putting \u00a39 million towards building new modular homes on top of some of London\u2019s buildings.",
        "An exciting venture that will see homes constructed offsite and then transported to 5 sites across the city \u2013 and that demonstrates our commitment to working with diverse developers to promote innovation and deliver for London.",
        "So, across board, this government is making every effort, from every angle, to get London \u2013 and Britain \u2013 building.",
        "And we now need to see the GLA also stepping up.",
        "Because despite all the talk of putting housing first, its record in recent years has been disappointing.",
        "And it\u2019s ordinary Londoners who are paying the price.",
        "I share your worries about the consequences.",
        "About the young people who can\u2019t afford to take up a job here because of sky-high rents.",
        "About the family who have to move out to get a place with a garden where their children can play.",
        "About the workers who keep London going priced out of even living within commuting distance.",
        "It\u2019s with them in mind that the government has raised concerns about the Mayor\u2019s draft London Plan, which we will be pursuing through the Examination in Public which is currently underway.",
        "But, first and foremost, we want to see the GLA urgently picking up the pace and delivering against their programme targets on the Affordable Homes Programme as well as the new land funds I mentioned earlier \u2013 and working with authorities in London and the South East, as well as private developers, to drive up overall housing delivery.",
        "London\u2019s boroughs can and must also lead the charge \u2013 both individually and by working together across boundaries \u2013 to match the record of those such as Croydon, Westminster and Wandsworth, which are going the extra mile to build more homes.",
        "Because there has been no better time \u2013 with all the support this government is providing \u2013 for local authorities to develop new partnerships and to be bolder and more ambitious in their thinking about how to drive up supply and meet their residents\u2019 needs.",
        "We can see this starting to happen through projects such as Capital Letters, an unprecedented collaboration between London\u2019s boroughs and government, backed by \u00a338 million of funding, to provide extra homes for vulnerable families who are at risk of becoming homeless.",
        "And on this same, critical issue, there\u2019s PLACE, the first collaboration of its kind by London\u2019s boroughs to use temporary modular accommodation to tackle homelessness.",
        "Exciting, inspiring examples of just what\u2019s possible when councils join forces and can count on government support when needed.",
        "We need others in the sector \u2013 developers, housing associations, forums like this \u2013 to also get involved and explore what more we can do.",
        "I\u2019m ready and willing to play my part in this \u2013 to work with individual boroughs, if needed, to push up supply.",
        "If you have thoughts and ideas about how we go further, faster, about what might be holding us back from delivering, tell me. I will listen.",
        "And, working together, I\u2019m confident that we can and will fix this \u2013 and raise the bar for all our communities.",
        "And, yes, that includes London.",
        "**Conclusion**",
        "Our capital punches well above its weight in so many respects, but we know that it includes people and places that are struggling to forge their own destinies, to reach their potential.",
        "Who can see success, but feel cut off from it.",
        "We have a chance to change that \u2013 to create a housing market that works for everyone.",
        "And, in doing so, create a country that works for everyone.",
        "That means not just building more homes, but building stronger communities.",
        "The terrible events at Grenfell and last year\u2019s terror attacks underline why this matters so much.",
        "So, we must keep this issue in our sights \u2013 especially if we\u2019re to ensure all parts of our country and all parts of our capital can take advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead.",
        "On this and on delivering the homes we need, there are few places better equipped to take the lead than London, with its endless diversity, boundless ambition and openness to the best the world has to offer.",
        "That\u2019s why this government is doing everything we can to deliver for the capital and its people.",
        "And it\u2019s now time for others with a stake in their future to make the most of the support and tools on offer and make the difference we all want to see\u2026",
        "\u2026this great city continuing to succeed, with all Londoners sharing in this success and being able to truly make it their home.",
        "Thank you."
