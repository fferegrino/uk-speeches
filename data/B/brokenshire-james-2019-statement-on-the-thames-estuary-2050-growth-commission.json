In June 2018, the commission, led originally by Lord Heseltine and concluded by Sir John Armitt, announced their vision for the estuary. I sincerely \u200bthank Sir John and all the members of the commission for their expertise and scrutiny across the duration of the commission.",

        "Thames estuary will be a tapestry of productive places along a global river. The estuary will create 1.3 million new jobs and generate \u00a3190 billion additional gross value added.",

        "I welcome the vision for growth that the commission has set out. I am pleased to announce further commitments from this Government to support the delivery of the commission\u2019s vision, including: \u00a31 million to support a new Thames estuary growth board; appointing a Cabinet-level ministerial champion; \u00a34.85 million to support local partners to develop low-cost proposals for enhancing transport services between Abbey Wood and Ebbsfleet, subject to suitable housing ambition; exploring the potential for at least two new locally-led development corporations; launching a strategic communications campaign to promote the Thames estuary as a great place to live, work and do business; funding for the creation of masterplans and feasibility studies on key sites in the Thames estuary creative production corridor; and bringing together relevant authorities to collaborate on the Thames estuary 2100 plan, to make sure that growth in the estuary is sustainable and resilient. My full response is available: www.gov.uk.",
        "Our response to the Thames Estuary 2050 Growth Commission marks this Government\u2019s commitment to this important area of the country. The Thames estuary has great potential to provide well-balanced, inclusive economic growth and will remain vital for the UK economy following Brexit."
