The total value of the funding from this round is up to \u00a3405 million, and colleges will also make a match funding contribution to their projects.",
        "The FE capital transformation programme delivers the Government\u2019s \u00a31.5 billion commitment to upgrade the estate of FE colleges and designated institutions in England, promoting parity of esteem between FE and other routes. Improving the condition of FE colleges is important in ensuring students have the opportunity to develop skills in high-quality buildings and facilities, and in addressing skills gaps in local economies.",
