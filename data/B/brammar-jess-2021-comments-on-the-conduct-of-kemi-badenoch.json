        "Hi Kemi, I am Nadine\u2019s editor. The correspondence you have published here shows the opposite of spreading disinformation \u2013 as you know, it is correct and standard practice for journalists to check facts and approach people in public office for comment.",
        "I\u2019m glad you highlighted our work on how Covid has hit Black people in the UK, much of which has been done by Nadine Writes. You will note that, contrary to your claim we were spreading disinformation, we have not published this story without your response."
