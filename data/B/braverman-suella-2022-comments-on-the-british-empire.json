        "[Asked how Braverman felt about stopping other people arriving her given her own heritage as her parents were from Mauritius and Kenya]",
        "**SUELLA BRAVERMAN**",
        "I have no qualms about that. Absolutely. Again, this is a kind of a common argument trotted out by the left that, you know, because of the colour of my skin and my heritage I have to think a certain way and I can\u2019t declare certain truths.",
        "**CHRISTOPHER HOPE**",
        "[Asked if she annoyed the left]",
        "**SUELLA BRAVERMAN**",
        "I hope I annoy them, that would be my delight if I was annoying the left. But no, I disagree with that. My parents came here through safe and legal routes. My mother was recruited by the NHS and my dad came here because he was effectively kicked out of Kenya in the 1960s, but they came here legitimately. That was the policy of the government, they came here, they integrated, they loved this country from afar as children of empire. They don\u2019t, by the way, have any qualms about extolling the virtues of the British Empire. It was the British Empire that brought infrastructure, the legal system, the civil service, the military to countries like Mauritius and Kenya. My parents are so proud. On my Mum\u2019s side, I think it\u2019s her great uncle and auntie, fought with the allies in World War Two and were so proud of that. So I think, you know, children of empire, there\u2019s obviously a mixed picture and obviously there are bad things about empire.",
        "**CHRISTOPHER HOPE**",
        "[Mentioned that history was complex]",
        "**SUELLA BRAVERMAN**",
        "History is complex and nuanced, and I\u2019m not going to apologise for empire. I\u2019m not going to apologise for our past history.",
        "**CHRISTOPHER HOPE**",
        "[Asked if we should be proud of empire]",
        "**SUELLA BRAVERMAN**",
        "I am proud of the British Empire, yes."
