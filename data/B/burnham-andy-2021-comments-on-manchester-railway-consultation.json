        "I welcome this consultation and the government\u2019s focus on this issue. The bottleneck in central Manchester is a problem for the whole of the north \u2013 and solving these congestion issues will improve the reliability of rail services for passengers right across the north.",
        "As we look to build back better from the pandemic, we want to work with the government to deliver a reliable and dependable timetable, alongside the much-needed upgrades to our Victorian infrastructure."
