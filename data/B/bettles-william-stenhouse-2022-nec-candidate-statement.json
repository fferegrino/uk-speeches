        "I am a 22 year old from Buckingham working in the retail industry. I have struggled throughout life giving me a grit and determination to fight for what is right. I have a strong sense of justice and am infuriated by injustice. I seek to bring these characteristics as your NEC CLP Representative. I am a Christian and a member of the *Christians on the Left* socialist society. I believe Jesus Christ gave us the model for a fair, free and compassionate society. I am your choice if you want a candidate who is inspired by Christian Socialist and Social Democrat values."
