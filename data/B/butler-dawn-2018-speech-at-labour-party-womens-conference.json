        "Good morning conference. What a year it\u2019s been for us.",
        "Sadly, we have lost the wonderful Tessa Jowell. But in her memory we have marched in our thousands against Trump, said enough is enough to sexual harassment, fought for the reproductive rights of women in Northern Ireland, called for an end to period poverty.",
        "And all this \u2013 in the centenary year of when some \u2013 but not all \u2013 women got the vote.",
        "This reminds us that \u2013 no woman should ever be left behind.",
        "You are phenomenal women \u2013 and you are vital to Labour winning the next election.",
        "We are the many, literally 51% of the UK population. We truly are the many.",
        "This Conservative Government has shown us their true colours \u2013 they have created a hostile environment for the Windrush generation and others \u2013 disabled people; the LGBT+ community; older women; BAME people.",
        "86% of the cuts have fallen on the shoulders of women \u2013 your shoulders \u2013 and now is time for the many to rise up.",
        "We need innovation and transformation on a scale like we have never seen before \u2013 transformation that works for working people \u2013 and for those who need a government that cares for them.",
        "Only a Labour Government will deliver for the many not the few.",
        "This Tory Government simply does not care \u2013 in fact almost every single policy they implement makes the lives of women worse.",
        "Women are poorly and under-paid \u2013 whether it is as a result of the gender pay gap or the unpaid caring responsibilities \u2013 this underpayment means that women can find it hard to care for themselves and their families.",
        "Women\u2019s refuges are in crisis, foodbanks on the rise \u2013 period poverty, all cuts have consequences.",
        "Local councils, have seen nearly 50% of their funding cut \u2013 I want to give a shout out to all the councillors fighting everyday against these Tory cuts.",
        "Conference, we are in Liverpool where over 30 years ago the council stood up to Thatcher and said-better to break the law than break the poor.",
        "Councils today should not have to consider cutting funding for women refuges, a lifeline to the most vulnerable.",
        "Labour alongside women\u2019s aid \u2013 has called for sustainable long-term funding and national oversight to set quality standards.",
        "But you know what conference, the woman at the head of Government \u2013 refuses to accept her failings \u2013 every Wednesday Jeremy highlights the consequences of her damaging policies but she refuses to listen \u2013 instead she feigns ignorance and spouts half-truths.",
        "Only a Labour government will deliver for the many not the few.",
        "Far from dealing with the \u201cburning injustices\u201d of society, we have a Government that pours petrol all over them.",
        "Martin Luther King said, \u2018our minds are being invaded by half-truths prejudice and false talks \u2013 there is little hope for us until we become tough-minded enough to break loose from these shackles.",
        "So break loose conference \u2013 break loose \u2013 hold your heads high \u2013 stand tall and believe in our traditional Labour values \u2013 and our ability to win with our socialist values \u2013 and our ability to make our country a better and fairer place for all.",
        "OK we are in opposition but with your help and with the phenomenal work of the trade unions we have had victories; scrapping employment tribunal fees; universal credit waiting time reduced; the resignation of Toby young.",
        "Just imagine what we will achieve in Government.",
        "We want to build a society where no one is held back v we can\u2019t carry on just tinkering around the edges \u2013 with equality an afterthought.",
        "The Conservatives have had seven different equality ministers tagged onto four different departments and a budget that\u2019s almost been halved.",
        "This proves the Tories are not taking equalities seriously.",
        "That\u2019s why the next Labour government will create a standalone department, headed by a secretary of state to reduce discrimination and inequality.",
        "The next Labour government will put equality centre stage.",
        "The next Labour government will protect all women",
        "Domestic abuse is a hidden killer and remains at epidemic levels.",
        "The most recent ONS survey shows 1.2 million women have experienced domestic abuse in a year. The impact on the victim and those around them is devastating.",
        "So it\u2019s time domestic abuse becomes everyone\u2019s business.",
        "Employers have a duty of care to employees experiencing domestic abuse.",
        "It can be done. We have already seen new employment laws introduced in the Philippines, Australia and most recently New Zealand granting victims the right to paid leave.",
        "So today I am proud to announce that Labour will require employers to have a domestic abuse employment policy and provide up to 10 days paid leave.",
        "This crucial time will allow women and men to leave their abusive partners safely \u2013 get the help \u2013 protection and support they need knowing their livelihood is secure.",
        "On average 2 women a week are murdered by a current or former abusive partner. These 10 days could literally help save the lives of those women.",
        "Only a Labour government will deliver for the many not the few.",
        "Under Labour we will help good businesses succeed; we want businesses to pay staff the real living wage; strive to end the gender pay gap; encourage paternity leavers.",
        "Under Labour, government contracts will go to companies who treat employees well.",
        "Only a Labour government will deliver for the many and not just the few.",
        "And conference, I have another announcement-planning for Government is quite empowering.",
        "For too long our laws have allowed discrimination to go unchallenged; conference, a Labour Government will change that; we will acknowledge intersectionality.",
        "Intersectionality is about how different layers of discrimination interact with each other \u2013 for example \u2013 our laws do not recognise the fact that black women can be discriminated against because they are both black and a woman; or a woman being discriminated against because of her age and gender; or disability and gender.",
        "A Labour government will change that and enact section 14 of the equality act, so people can bring forward cases on multiple grounds of discrimination.",
        "A Labour Government will create an environment \u2013 at home \u2013 at work and in public spaces, which will encourage people to be their true authentic selves.",
        "Conference just imagine if all the men fought for the rights of women, equal pay would be achieved overnight.",
        "Just imagine if all white people fought for the rights of black people \u2013 racism would no longer be so prevalent in our society \u2013 and just imagine if all of the straight people fought for the rights of the LGBT+ community \u2013 homophobia would be a thing of the past.",
        "And I could go on.",
        "But imagine our society, truly a place for the many and not the few, we have to be that society we have to be the change we seek.",
        "Only a Labour Government will deliver for the many not the few.",
        "We will rebuild our country for the many not the few.",
        "This is not an easy battle to fight \u2013 or win \u2013 they will throw everything at us. But we have to be tough-minded \u2013 we have to be steadfast in our vision \u2013 and we have to be our true authentic selves.",
        "We have to be the flood of positivity to drown out all of the negativity.",
        "Because we are the many;",
        "_When the sharpest words wanna cut me down,_",
        "_I\u2019m gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out._",
        "_I am brave, I am bruised._",
        "_I am who I\u2019m meant to be, this is me._",
        "_Look out \u2019cause here I come._",
        "_And I\u2019m marching on to the beat I drum._",
        "_I\u2019m not scared to be seen._",
        "_I make no apologies, this is me._"
