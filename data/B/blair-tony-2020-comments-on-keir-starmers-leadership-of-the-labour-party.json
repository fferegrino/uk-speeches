    "content": [
        "Keir\u2019s doing a good job, a very good job actually. I think he\u2019s put Labour back on the map and he has made them competitive again. He will know, and we all know, that there\u2019s a long way to go before a General Election and many things to be done. But, in these months since he\u2019s become the leader, he\u2019s completely changed the image of the Labour leadership amongst the public and he deserves respect and admiration for that.",
        "There are a whole other set of questions around policy that in time that I\u2019m sure and know he will come to. But, has he made it politically competitive again which it hasn\u2019t really been for quite a long period of time? Yes, and that\u2019s a huge step forwards for the Labour Party."
