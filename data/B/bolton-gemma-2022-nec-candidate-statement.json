        "I\u2019m standing for re-election to Labour\u2019s NEC to continue to fight for a socialist and democratic party which upholds the rulebook, decisions of its annual conference, and puts members and working people at its core.",
        "To win, Labour must fight for a socialist policy agenda in opposition to Conservative attacks on our jobs, health, shared values and living standards. We must oppose Tory austerity; support public ownership; a Green New Deal; a peace-oriented, independent foreign policy and fight rising poverty and racism.",
        "As an NEC member I have:",
        "\u2013 Worked to create new democratic Student and BAME structures  \n\u2013 Produced detailed written reports of NEC meetings  \n\u2013 Voted to return the whip to Jeremy Corbyn  \n\u2013 Campaigned for the publication of the Forde Report  \n\u2013 Opposed unfair proscriptions and expulsions  \n\u2013 Opposed rule changes that weaken members\u2019 rights",
        "I have fought for democracy and a greater voice for grassroots members at all levels of our party, including on the South East Regional Executive, Women\u2019s Conference Arrangements Committee, and as co-Chair of the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy (CLPD).",
        "I\u2019m proudly endorsed by the Centre-Left Grassroots Alliance (CLGA) including CLPD and Momentum. Please support the other CLGA endorsed candidates."
