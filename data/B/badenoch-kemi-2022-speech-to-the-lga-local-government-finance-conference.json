    "summary": "The speech made by Kemi Badenoch, the Minister of State at the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, at the LGA Local Government Finance Conference on 13 January 2022.",
    "content": [
        "Thank you, James [Jamieson]. Its what you get when a Treasury Minister comes in to local government rather than the other way around. So I\u2019m glad that the sector is pleased, and I think I\u2019d start off by saying a little bit about the role of local government just in terms of delivering for our communities. It\u2019s never been more important than through this incredibly challenging period. And it was good to hear you speak about the sector\u2019s priorities and how we can ensure that you all are well-equipped to do the best possible job.",
        "It\u2019s my pleasure to be setting out the government\u2019s position this morning.",
        "This is my first keynote speech as a Minister for Local Government so please be nice when it comes to the Q&A! I am still early on the learning curve.",
        "First of all I\u2019d like to thank the many councillors, and council officers as well, who are joining us this morning for your tireless efforts \u2013 not just through the pandemic but in everything you do. I used to be married to a local councillor so I know what it\u2019s like and I just want to say thank you.",
        "From the department\u2019s perspective you have been \u2013 and remain \u2013 at the very forefront of our response to COVID.",
        "From your efforts in shielding the vulnerable, protecting those people who have been isolated, helping over 37,000 rough sleepers off the streets through Everyone In\u2026 all of this has been absolutely heroic.",
        "And right through to your on-going work today, you\u2019re making sure that the booster rollout has been the incredible success that it has been. You\u2019ve been welcoming and helping Afghan refugees safely settle in the UK through Operation Warm Welcome. And it\u2019s really hard to think of a time when local government, local councils, local councillors, all of you, council officers, it\u2019s hard to think of a time when you\u2019ve played a more important part in the history of our country. So thank you very much.",
        "That\u2019s why, since the start of the pandemic, we have provided \u00a313 billion in support and compensation for income losses that you had, to help you tackle the worst effects that the virus wrought.",
        "And we are determined that you have the tools, the funding and the resources you need, not just to continue the work, but to forge a lasting recovery \u2013 you know, the PM talks about building back better, as he says \u2013 that\u2019s really what we want you to be able to do going forward.",
        "**Bigger picture**",
        "So looking at the bigger picture \u2013 before turning to the settlement itself, I think it\u2019s important to reflect on some of the broader developments the sector has seen over the past few months.",
        "There have been important developments in grant funding for councils, so the \u00a31.6 billion of additional grant for the year 2022/2023 announced at the Spending Review last October.",
        "This new grant provides additional support for critical programmes like Supporting Families, of which I am very interested, and Cyber Resilience, as well as new funding which will be distributed through the settlement.",
        "We\u2019ve seen changes in the way we support local investment too, this is before my time, but recognising the vital role this plays in service delivery, in housing provision and of course in levelling up, which is what we are all about.",
        "In June last year, I have been reliably informed by my visuals, we published our plan to make sure the capital investment system continues to support local decision-making freedom but at the same time preventing that excessive \u2013 the excess risk taking, from a small number of local authorities.",
        "And, as many of you know, in December, the government published the adult social care reform white paper, People at the Heart of Care, which sets out our 10-year vision along with a commitment to invest \u00a35.4 billion in the sector over the next 3 years.",
        "**Provisional local government finance settlement (LGFS)**",
        "So as we look to the future, we want to work in hand in hand with you, given all the issues that you\u2019ve raised with us over the last few months and year, that\u2019s really the approach underpinning the provisional local government finance settlement we announced last month.",
        "So the settlement delivers an additional \u00a33.5 billion for the sector and a real terms funding increase of over 4% for councils in the year ahead, which I hope you\u2019re all really pleased to hear. Feel free to put the applause emojis on the Zoom. It\u2019s not always easy getting money out of the Treasury but we\u2019re very, very pleased with the settlement.",
        "Most of the \u00a31.6 billion of new funding announced at Spending Review will be allocated through the settlement, including that additional \u00a3822 million for all services that you\u2019re all curious about, through that one-off 2022/23 Services Grant \u2013 and we believe that this is substantial support in what remains a very testing time.",
        "You also asked us for stability \u2013 and this settlement provides stability, and a firm foundation on which to build and grow, rolling over support like the New Homes Bonus, the Rural Services Delivery Grant, and the Lower Tier Services Grant, and it also increases the Revenue Support Grant by \u00a370 million and updates the funding floor, which is something James and others have been really keen to see, so it updates the funding floor so that no council anywhere in England receives less money than last year.",
        "And I know some of you will accuse us of just doing a Goldilocks, but we think we\u2019ve done the right thing with a core referendum principle of 2%, plus an additional 1% adult social care precept, we believe this is a settlement that strikes the right balance between giving councils flexibility to raise income whilst also protecting our very hard-working taxpayers.",
        "**Social care**",
        "But importantly, this settlement also recognises the significant pressures on social care \u2013 with an extra \u00a31 billion made available to alleviate this pressure in the year ahead.",
        "So this increases the Social Care Grant and the improved Better Care Fund. You can also make use of the 1% adult social care precept I just mentioned, in addition to the deferred precept flexibilities which have been rolled over from last year\u2019s settlement.",
        "But please be in no doubt, we don\u2019t underestimate the scale of support that the sector requires, especially as we start this decade-defining challenge of putting social care on a more sustainable footing.",
        "And it\u2019s why, on top of this funding to address those core pressures, there\u2019s also \u00a3162 million being made available to help you prepare for adult social care reform and ensuring the system is fit for future generations.",
        "**Long-term future of the sector**",
        "So in terms of the long-term future of our local government, our unequivocal ambition and Secretary of State will have told you this already \u2013 is to help councils \u2013 to help you \u2013 meet the challenges of today while planning for tomorrow\u2019s opportunities. We don\u2019t want you to always be in crisis mode, always being reactive.",
        "And that\u2019s why we want to ensure that funding allocations are based on an up-to-date assessment of needs and resources.",
        "One challenge is that the data used to make this assessment has not been updated in several years \u2013 a lot of it is coming from 2013/14, nearly 10 years ago, and some even as far back as the turn of the millennium. I don\u2019t want to say \u2018pre-historic\u2019 but it\u2019s difficult to properly forecast using data that came before Windows XP!",
        "So, over the coming months, we will work closely with you and all our partners from across the sector to look at the many challenges and opportunities facing local government before consulting on potential reform in the spring.",
        "A key piece in this puzzle will be finding the right options to make sure that local authorities are supported through any change with transitional protection.",
        "So we also know that there is significant diversity across the sector, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re keen to hear your views and ensure that the unique circumstances of your local areas are fully understood. We\u2019re not treating you as a homogenous block \u2013 that would be ridiculous. We have different needs and we want to know what we can do and as far as we can go in terms of tailoring the solutions to do what\u2019s right for you.",
        "**Conclusion**",
        "It\u2019s in that spirit of collaboration and partnership that we want to continue to work with you, bearing down on Omicron, plotting a clear course out of this pandemic and its one of the reasons why the local government finance settlement is never presented as a done deal. It\u2019s always provisional until you\u2019ve helped us make it final.",
        "I want to sincerely thank all of you who have taken part in the consultation on the provisional settlement. And for those who yet haven\u2019t shared their views please do so today, deadline is 11:45pm. So, 15 minutes before midnight is when it closes. I can\u2019t promise that I will be staying up quite that late to see your responses in person, but I really do want to hear your views and continue to work with you to put us on the best possible footing for this year.",
        "I will finish by saying that central government and local government are at their strongest when working together, united in purpose.",
        "And what we have accomplished over the last 2 years is nothing short of remarkable.",
        "So, this settlement \u2013 I believe \u2013 provides the strong foundations on which to go forward as we build a brighter future beyond COVID."
