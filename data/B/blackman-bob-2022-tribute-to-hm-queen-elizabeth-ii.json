    "summary": "The tribute made by Bob Blackman, the Conservative MP for Harrow East, in the House of Commons on 10 September 2022.",
    "content": [
        "Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to speak about the long and dedicated life of Her Majesty the Queen on behalf of my constituents in Harrow East, my friends and family, and myself.",
        "Harrow has a unique royal link, being the first borough created when Her Majesty the Queen came to the throne. We have had many royal visits, over many years, and we have celebrated every jubilee. Earlier this year, we celebrated the platinum jubilee with civic functions but, more importantly, with the street parties that many hon. Members have spoken about.",
        "I want to mention two of those visits, which contrast the way that Harrow, and indeed the country, changed during the Queen\u2019s reign. The first was some 50 years ago, when she visited Harrow School on the 400th anniversary of its creation\u2014it is far better than that school just down the road from Windsor castle. The second visit demonstrates that within our borough Harrow now has people from literally every country on the planet, every religion and every language spoken on earth. That visit was during her diamond jubilee in 2012, when we celebrated her coming to Krishna Avanti Primary School, the first state-sponsored Hindu primary school in the country, where children from across the borough came together to meet her.",
        "On my personal memories, I remember parading at Windsor castle as a Queen\u2019s Scout and meeting the Queen at her garden parties as a councillor, a member of the London Assembly and an MP. My favourite memory was as a newly elected MP being allowed to drive through the gates of Buckingham Palace and park in the centre of the palace, before climbing the stairs and being greeted by Her Majesty the Queen directly.",
        "I am an avowed royalist and monarchist, and we pass on our grief to the royal family for the loss of Her Majesty the Queen. It is fair to say that King Charles III has had the longest apprenticeship in history and he has already demonstrated the wisdom of having the hereditary system to those who do not believe in it. To Her Majesty the Queen we say, \u201cGod bless. Thank you for your dedicated service, ma\u2019am. Om Shanti. Rest in peace.\u201d And to King Charles III we say, \u201cMay you live a long life. Long live the King.\u201d"
