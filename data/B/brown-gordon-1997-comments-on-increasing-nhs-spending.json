        "This [new money](https://www.ukpol.co.uk/historic-press-release-extra-300-million-pounds-for-nhs-patient-care-october-1997/) for NHS patient care will go to where it is needed most.",
        "The Government\u2019s approach is clear.",
        "We will maintain the control totals we set and therefore achieve the public spending discipline needed for sustainable finances. Savings will be found from within existing resources.",
        "And we will use money saved to fund our priorities, of which NHS patient care is one.",
        "Indeed, we will continue to be relentless in our search for savings, where money can be redirected to priorities.",
        "The new initiatives, including the appointment of best practice teams, will ensure better use of resources. We are satisfied that the money announced today will go to where it is needed most, for patient care during the winter months."
