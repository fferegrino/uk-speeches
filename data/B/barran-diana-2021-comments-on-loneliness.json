        "As we emerge from lockdown, it\u2019s critical to remember that some people will remain isolated, and loneliness will not simply go away. This is why the Government is committed to continuing to tackle loneliness as a national priority.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "The local organisations benefiting from these grants are a powerful way of connecting small groups of people across communities in England. I\u2019m delighted that the Local Connections Fund is giving people an opportunity to do things they enjoy, whilst helping tackle loneliness.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "It is a privilege to have worked alongside the organisations in the Tackling Loneliness Network to produce our action plan, and I am confident that the commitments we\u2019ve made will be a positive step towards ending the loneliness that has blighted so many lives in the past year.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body"
