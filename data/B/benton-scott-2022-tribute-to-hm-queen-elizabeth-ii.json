    "content": [
        "I rise with great sadness to pay tribute to Her late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II personally and on behalf of all the people of Blackpool South. Throughout her long reign, Queen Elizabeth was a figure of national pride, a symbol of stability and continuity, and an inspiration to so many, myself included. Just as importantly\u2014we must not forget this\u2014she was a loving mother, grandmother and great-grandmother.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "Just a couple of months ago, I attended street parties across Blackpool for the platinum jubilee. The celebrations brought together people from all backgrounds and faiths, and the old and the young; it was testament to her ability to unite the whole country and to keep the monarch at the forefront of our nation\u2019s life during a reign that saw unparalleled social change. She opened up the family to the general public, and made us feel as though we knew her personally. In return, over the decades, we loved her and shared in her joy\u2014and her grief, most notably on the sad loss of her rock, Prince Philip, only last year. Those constituents of mine who had the privilege of meeting her always, without exception, spoke about her warmth and humility, and how she made them feel so special.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "When Her late Majesty was born, it was not likely that she would become Queen, let alone Britain\u2019s longest-reigning monarch, but from the very beginning, service to her country was in her DNA. Her devotion to this country is encapsulated in a remarkable speech that she gave on her birthday, when she was just 21. She stated that\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "\u201cwe must give nothing less than the whole of ourselves\u201d,\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "and took on the noble motto, \u201cI serve\u201d. Unquestionably, she gave the whole of herself to this country. That is epitomised by the way that she served the country until the very end; she swore in her 15th Prime Minister just three days ago. It will take a long time for the tremendous sadness felt by us all to pass, but we can be comforted by the way that she touched the hearts of so many and served our glorious nation so well.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body",
        "The example that Queen Elizabeth set has been instilled in King Charles III\u2019s sense of duty and service. At a time of immense sadness for him, he has taken on the responsibilities of the Crown, and the leadership of our nation and the Commonwealth. Our thoughts and prayers are with him, and we offer him our loyalty and devotion at this difficult time, just as we know that he will give his to us. As we move into a new era in this great country\u2019s history, Her late Majesty will always remain in our hearts. God rest her soul, and God save the King.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body"
