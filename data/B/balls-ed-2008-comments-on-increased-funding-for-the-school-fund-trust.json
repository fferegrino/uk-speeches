        "There are no quick, overnight solutions to improving the way we eat as a nation. I make no apology for introducing tough nutritional standards for school food \u2013 there is nothing more important than our children\u2019s well-being. I want every young person to be able to make informed choices about healthy eating for the rest of their lives.",
        "The School Food Trust is at the forefront of improving take up of school dinners. It continues to make massive progress in raising school food quality and supporting local authorities and schools in changing the attitudes of parents and young people."
