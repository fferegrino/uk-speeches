        "It\u2019s a life-and-death issue, we\u2019re actually deciding who lives and who dies, particularly at this point where if we withdraw the money for vaccination it\u2019s the equivalent of pulling away the needle from a kid or from an adult who is sick who needs the vaccination, a 90% cut, for example, in support for polio vaccination.",
        "There has been an all-party consensus, all parties, for 25 years that we need 0.7%, we need to play our role in the world by being one of the leaders in aid and, really, this is not the right time to pull things away because basically this is when the poorest countries need help most."
