        "It is not right that those who seek to undermine and abuse our system are jumping the queue, taking resources from the people who are in genuine need.",
        "While some critics provide only fairytale suggestions and the Labour Party champions open borders and has no desire or plan to crack down on illegal migration, I am working night and day on real, viable solutions. Our joint UK-France intelligence cell has dismantled 55 organised crime groups since 2020.",
        "In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll take further steps to bear down on the people-smuggling gangs operating on French beaches. The French authorities, with our support, have stopped more than 29,000 illegal crossings since the start of the year \u2013 twice as many as last year \u2013 and destroyed more than 1,000 boats. My French counterpart, Gerald Darmanin, and I are working to build greater co-operation, and make better use of UK surveillance technology."
