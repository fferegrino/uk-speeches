        "I welcome the Supreme Court\u2019s judgement that the prorogation of Parliament was unlawful. The judges have rejected the Government\u2019s claim that closing down Parliament for five weeks was merely standard practice to allow for a new Queen\u2019s Speech. In reaching their conclusion, they have vindicated the right and duty of Parliament to meet at this crucial time to scrutinise the executive and hold Ministers to account. As the embodiment of our Parliamentary democracy, the House of Commons must convene without delay. To this end, I will now consult the party leaders as a matter of urgency."
