        "Our landmark Inclusive Britain strategy makes clear that we are a welcoming country whose strength lies within its communities. So, when people try to create divisions amongst us, we must be unwavering in our resolve to stay united.",
        "By sharing your views, you will be helping ensure that our work to tackle extremism continues on the right track \u2013 so that risks in our communities are easily recognised and swiftly dealt with, and we can build resilience and promote social cohesion.",
        "Our levelling up mission includes empowering communities \u2013 and this call to action is a great example of that ideal in action."
