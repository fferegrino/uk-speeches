    "content": [
        "The phrase \u201cwhite privilege\u201d is unnecessarily antagonistic. Much as some theorists think it is essential for tackling racism, there is an active and fairly toxic political debate around it. All the more reason why the phrase should not be taught in schools unless it is explained that it is also contentious.",
        "It is important to tackle racial discrimination. But these matters must be handled sensitively. Normalising the term \u201cwhite privilege\u201d does not eliminate racism, it reinforces the notion that everyone and everything around ethnic minorities is racist and makes the majority white population more conscious about their race and exacerbates feelings of difference, creating a less cohesive society."
