    "summary": "The text of a podcast made by Gordon Brown, the then Prime Minister, on 3 April 2010.",
    "content": [
        "For many of us, Easter is a time for reflection and spending time together as a family.",
        "I know that times have been tough and that many people are still apprehensive about their jobs, their homes and their businesses.",
        "Whether it\u2019s a worker watching their wages, or a parent juggling the household budget, or a small business owner calculating the cash flow, I hear every day how worried people still are.",
        "Our economy has just been through a global financial crisis and at the moment we\u2019re in a period of fragile recovery. In the past few months growth has returned. In fact, latest figures show that in the last quarter of 2009 the economy grew faster than people originally thought \u2013 by 0.4 per cent.",
        "And in the last three months we have seen unemployment fall. And we have seen vacancies rise.",
        "In total 300,000 men and women are leaving the unemployment register every month.",
        "The improved \u2018Time to Pay\u2019 scheme has given over 200,000 businesses longer to pay \u00a35bn worth of tax. These businesses employ more than 1.4 million people, and the additional time has helped those businesses pay more of the tax they owed.",
        "And this year almost half a million families have received extra tax credits.",
        "All our efforts have been focused on getting us through the recession \u2013 and now they are designed to secure the recovery.",
        "That\u2019s why we have a designed a plan to secure the recovery and raise your living standards.",
        "First of all, we are continuing the vital support we have been giving the economy until recovery has firmly taken root.",
        "That includes the extra investments we\u2019re making in big infrastructure projects like high-speed rail \u2013 and the support we are giving to the sectors which will underpin our return to prosperity: industries like low carbon; digital; advanced manufacturing and life sciences.",
        "And secondly, we are from this month increasing the support we\u2019re giving to small businesses \u2013 the backbone of our UK economy.",
        "Our Time to Pay scheme is now being extended until the end of the next Parliament.",
        "And we\u2019re cutting business rates from October for a year for over half a million small businesses in England \u2013 345,000 of whom will pay no business rates at all.",
        "And then thirdly, we are increasing the number of jobs created for young people through the actions of the Future Jobs Fund.",
        "This is providing up to 120,000 paid jobs for young people and a further 50,000 jobs for those over 25 in the hardest hit areas.",
        "In total we\u2019ve put \u00a35 billion in to help people looking for jobs \u2013 money that some people opposed.",
        "I believe that securing the recovery is the biggest issue facing our country. That means we shouldn\u2019t take money out of the economy this year.",
        "Let me explain it a bit like this: I know Wayne Rooney\u2019s just had an injury to his foot and I know everyone will be hoping he\u2019s fit for the World Cup but after an injury you need support to recover, you need support to get back to match fitness, you need support to get back your full strength and then go on to lift the World Cup.",
        "So with the economy \u2013 we\u2019re not back to full fitness, we need to maintain support. If you withdraw support too early, we\u2019ll risk doing more damage. And that\u2019s why so many people \u2013 the CBI, IMF, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, economists and other thinkers and the vast majority of business people I\u2019ve spoken to say it\u2019s wrong to take money out of the economy this year. And that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s wrong to say that we should take six or seven billion pounds out of the economy this year.",
        "Now of course we need to make sure that money goes to skills, to jobs, to small businesses and to job creation and we need to be ruthless on cutting down on waste \u2013 and we\u2019re doing that \u2013 but if we try and jump off the treatment table as if nothing had happened we\u2019ll do more damage to the economy \u2013 and frankly that means we risk a double-dip recession.",
        "I think that\u2019s a risk we can\u2019t afford to take. So going for growth and jobs to achieve prosperity for all is the overriding duty and responsibility of this Government \u2013 and I promise you we will not let you or your family down."
