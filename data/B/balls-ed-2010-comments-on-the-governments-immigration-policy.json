    "content": [
        "The government\u2019s immigration policy is in a state of chaos. Their so called cap may have sounded good before the election but it wasn\u2019t properly thought through and didn\u2019t get the scrutiny it deserved. Not only will it do little to control immigration it also risks damaging British businesses. Cutting the number of border officers and staff by nearly a quarter raises serious questions about the security of our borders and whether the government\u2019s policies can be enforced. And David Cameron\u2019s flagship election promise to bring net migration down to the tens of thousands has now been watered down from a firm pledge to just an aim."
