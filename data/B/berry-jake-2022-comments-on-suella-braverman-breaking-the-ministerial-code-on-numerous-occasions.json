        "**INTERVIEWER:**",
        "[Was it right that Suella Braverman came back to the Cabinet?]",
        "**JAKE BERRY:**",
        "Six days is a long time in politics. It\u2019s for the new Prime Minister and he must be free to appoint whoever he wants. However, what I would say is from my own knowledge, there were multiple breaches of the ministerial code",
        "**INTERVIEWER:**",
        "[Multiple?]",
        "**JAKE BERRY:**",
        "Multiple breaches of ministerial code. It was sent from a private email address to another Member of Parliament, she then sought to copy in that individual\u2019s wife and accidentally sent it to a staffer in Parliament. To me, that seems a really serious breach and especially when it was documents relating to cybersecurity as I believe that seems a really serious breach. The cabinet secretary had his say at the time, I doubt he\u2019s changed his mind in the last six days, but that\u2019s a matter for the new Prime Minister",
        "**INTERVIEWER:**",
        "[Did she hold her hands up to it?]",
        "**JAKE BERRY:**",
        "I wasn\u2019t at the meeting, but as I understand it the evidence was put to her and she accepted the evidence rather than the other way around."
