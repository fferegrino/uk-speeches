        "Here we have Number 10, a government in London, breaking its own Covid rules and then joking about it on a video. It really isn\u2019t acceptable and I have to say, unfortunately, that on the basis of this behaviour, because it\u2019s not just about this, it fits a pattern of a Prime Minister that repeatedly lies, a Prime Minister that can\u2019t be trusted. He should go and he should go now."
