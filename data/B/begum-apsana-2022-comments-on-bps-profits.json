        "BP have just announced quarterly profits of \u00a37.1 billion \u2014 more than double what they made this time last year. A windfall tax & public ownership of energy would slash bills and improve living standards. But Tory MPs repeatedly vote this down in the interests of the super-rich.\n  *[NHSPRB]: NHS Pay Review Body"
