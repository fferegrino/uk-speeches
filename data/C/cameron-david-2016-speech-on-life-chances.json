        "**Introduction**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "This government is all about security.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "It\u2019s that security that underpins our long-term economic plan: in a world of risks, we want to ensure the British economy, and British families, are secure.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "It\u2019s security that drives our defence policy and strategy to combat extremism: in dangerous times, we know our first duty is to keep our country safe.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And it\u2019s our national and economic security that is front and centre of my mind as I renegotiate a better deal for Britain in Europe.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Security is also what drives the social reform that I want this government to undertake in my second term.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Individuals and families who are in poverty crave security \u2013 for them, it\u2019s the most important value of all.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But those who are struggling often have no security and no real chance of security.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "The economy can\u2019t be secure if we spend billions of pounds on picking up the pieces of social failure and our society can\u2019t be strong and cohesive as long as there are millions of people who feel locked out of it.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So economic reform and social reform are not two separate agendas they are intimately connected to one another.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And that social reform begins \u2013 as I set out 3 months ago in Manchester \u2013 with an all-out-assault on poverty.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Today, I want to explain how we can transform the life chances of the poorest in our country and offer every child who has had a difficult start the promise of a brighter future.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We should begin by recognising our real achievements in fighting poverty.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We\u2019ve seen huge progress over the past 50 years, with rising living standards and big improvements in terms of people\u2019s incomes, health, employment, education and in child mortality rates.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And of course we\u2019ve made progress in the last 5 years, too.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Since 2010 alone, the number of children growing up in workless households is at a record low; down by 480,000.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And because of our strong economy, we can do more.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But we know that, despite the good news in our economy, there are still people left behind.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "In particular, too many are held back because of generational unemployment, addiction or poor mental health.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Of course, it isn\u2019t so much the dreadful material poverty that was so widespread in decades gone by \u2013 though of course some still exists.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Today, it is more often the paucity of opportunity of those left behind that is the greatest problem.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And some in our country don\u2019t just get left behind; they start behind.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Today in Britain, around a million children are growing up without the love of a dad.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "In Britain, a child born in a poor area will die an average of 9 years earlier than their peers.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "In Britain, there are more young black men in our prisons than there are studying at a Russell Group university.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "These problems \u2013 they have been years in the making, and will take time to tackle.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But I am convinced it doesn\u2019t have to be like this, and we can make a real difference.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "In the spring, we will publish our Life Chances Strategy setting out a comprehensive plan to fight disadvantage and extend opportunity.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Today, I want to set out the principles that will guide us.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "In doing so, I want to make a big argument.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We will only ever make a real dent in this problem if we break free from all of the old, outdated thinking about poverty.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And I want to explain how, by applying a more sophisticated and deeper understanding of what disadvantage means in Britain today we can transform life chances.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "**20th century thinking**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "The old thinking on fighting poverty \u2013 what I would call 20th century thinking \u2013 still dominates political debate in Britain.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "There are two schools of thought that have traditionally defined our approach.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "The first is the leftist, statist view \u2013 built around increased welfare provision and more government intervention.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "I am not against state intervention.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "I\u2019m the Prime Minister who started the Troubled Families programme \u2013 perhaps the most intensive form of state intervention there is.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And I support the welfare state.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "I believe the creation of those vital safety nets was one of the outstanding achievements of post-war Britain.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But we know too that this approach has real limitations, and these have become badly exposed in recent times.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "This fixation on welfare \u2013 the state writing a cheque to push people\u2019s incomes just above the poverty line \u2013 this treated the symptoms, not the causes of poverty; and, over time, it trapped some people in dependency.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Frankly, it was built around a patronising view that people in poverty needed simply to be pitied and managed, instead of actually helped to break free.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "The second approach is the more free market one \u2013 the idea that a rising tide will lift all boats.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "I believe the free market has been, by far, the best tool ever invented for generating prosperity and improving living standards.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And actually applying its principles of more choice and competition to our public services has, I believe, helped the most disadvantaged.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But some people get left behind, even as the market transforms our economy and the rest of society with it.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "They haven\u2019t been equipped to make the most of the opportunities presented to them \u2013 and a chasm exists between them, and those who have been able to take advantage.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Now I believe in self-reliance and personal responsibility \u2013 I think that\u2019s absolutely correct.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But we have to recognise that this alone is not enough \u2013 so if we want to transform life chances \u2013 we\u2019ve got to go much deeper.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "**A more social approach**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So it\u2019s clear to me the returns from pursuing these two old approaches to poverty aren\u2019t just diminishing, in some cases they\u2019re disappearing in the modern world.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And we need to understand precisely why.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Both approaches had one thing in common. They focused on the economics, and ignored the social.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "They missed that human dimension to poverty: the social causes, the reasons people can get stuck, and become isolated.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Let me put it another way.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Talk to a single mum on a poverty-stricken estate: someone who suffers from chronic depression, someone who perhaps drinks all day to numb the pain of the sexual abuse she suffered as a child.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Tell her that because her benefits have risen by a couple of pounds a week, she and her children have been magically lifted out of poverty.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Or on the other hand, if you told her about the great opportunities created by our market economy, I expect she\u2019ll ask you what planet you\u2019re actually on.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Of course the economy is absolutely vital.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "That\u2019s why seeing through our long-term plan isn\u2019t optional.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We will never defeat poverty unless we manage the economy responsibly because in the end it\u2019s always the poorest who suffer most when governments lose control of the public finances.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And of course, we will never defeat poverty unless we back businesses to create jobs.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Work is \u2013 and always will be \u2013 the best route out of poverty and with welfare reform, Universal Credit, tax cuts and the introduction of the National Living Wage, we are making sure that it always pays to work.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And we\u2019ll continue to tackle the scourge of worklessness in Britain including by reforming the way we support people who fall ill, so that they can stay in work and aren\u2019t just consigned to a life stuck on benefits.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And because the evidence shows that families where only one parent is in work are more at risk of poverty we are going to back all those who want to work.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "That\u2019s why our offer for working parents \u2013 of 30 hours a week of free childcare for 3 and 4 year olds \u2013 is so important.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But to really defeat poverty, we need to move beyond the economics.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We need a more social approach.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "One where we develop a richer picture of how social problems combine, of how they reinforce each other, how they can manifest themselves throughout someone\u2019s life and how the opportunity gap gets generated as a result.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Above all, we need to think big, be imaginative not just leaving behind the old thinking, but opening ourselves up to the new thinking.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "For instance, the pioneering research that shows us why some children from poor families can climb right to the top while others seem condemned almost from birth to a life of struggle and stress.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And there are four vital, social insights that I believe must anchor our plan for extending life chances.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "First, when neuroscience shows us the pivotal importance of the first few years of life in determining the adults we become, we must think much more radically about improving family life and the early years.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Second, when we know the importance not just acquiring knowledge, but also developing character and resilience there can be no let-up in our mission to create an education system that is genuinely fit for the 21st century.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Third, it\u2019s now so clear that social connections and experiences are vitally important in helping people get on.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So when we know about the power of the informal mentors, the mixing of communities, the broadened horizons, the art and culture that adolescents are exposed to, it\u2019s time to build a more level playing field with opportunity for everyone, regardless of their background.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And fourth, when we know that so many of those in poverty have specific, treatable problems such as alcoholism, drug addiction, poor mental health we\u2019ve got to offer the right support, including to those in crisis.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "This is what I would call a life cycle approach \u2013 one that takes people from their earliest years, through schooling, adolescence and adult life.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And I believe if we take the right action in each of these 4 areas combined, with all we are doing to bring our economy back to health, we can make a significant impact on poverty and on disadvantage in our country.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "At the same time, it\u2019s right that we move away from looking simply at income-based poverty measures and develop more sophisticated social indicators to measure success.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So let me set out in more depth some of the steps we will take in each of these four areas. Apologies for the length of what I\u2019m going to say but I wanted to bring together in one place all the things that we are doing.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "**Families and the early years**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "First, family and those crucial early years.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Families are the best anti-poverty measure ever invented.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "They are a welfare, education and counselling system all wrapped up into one.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Children in families that break apart are more than twice as likely to experience poverty as those whose families stay together.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "That\u2019s why strengthening families is at the heart of our agenda.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We\u2019ve significantly increased the help we offer on childcare, introduced shared parental leave so families can be there for one another at the most stressful time \u2013 the birth of a child.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We\u2019ve backed marriage in the tax system and 160,000 couples have taken up the preventative relationship support that we have funded over the last 5 years.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And I can announce today that we will double our investment in this Parliament, with an extra \u00a335 million to offer even more relationship support.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We\u2019ll also to do more to help people save \u2013 and help build families\u2019 financial resilience.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Those with no savings at all have no buffer \u2013 no shock absorber \u2013 for when unexpected events hit.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Saving is a habit that should start early \u2013 so we are going to expand the Church of England\u2019s LifeSavers project which helps primary schoolchildren to manage money and learn how to save and we will look at what more we can be done on this vital area.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So I can announce today that we intend to bring forward a \u2018help to save\u2019 scheme to encourage those on low incomes to build up a rainy day fund, and full details of this scheme will be announced at the Budget.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "All of this will help to prevent the relationship strain that can be caused by financial difficulties.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But when it comes to life chances, it isn\u2019t just the relationship between parents that matters.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "What is just as important is the relationship between parent and child.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Thanks to the advent of functional MRI scanners, neuroscientists and biologists say they have learnt more about how the brain works in the last ten years than in the rest of human history put together.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And one critical finding is that the vast majority of the synapses the billions of connections that carry information through our brains develop in the first two years.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Destinies can be altered for good or ill in this window of opportunity.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "On the one hand, we know the severe developmental damage that can be done in these so-called foundation years when babies are emotionally neglected, abused or if they witness domestic violence.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "As Dr Jack Shonkoff\u2019s research at Harvard University has shown, children who suffer what he calls \u2018toxic stress\u2019 in those early years are potentially set up for a life of struggle, risky behaviour, poor social outcomes, all driven by abnormally high levels of the stress hormone, cortisol.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "On the other hand, we also know \u2013 it\u2019s common sense \u2013 how a safe, stimulating, loving family environment can make such a positive difference.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "One study found that by the age of three, some toddlers might have heard 30 million more words in their home environment than others. That is a staggering statistic.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "The more words children heard, the higher their IQ, and the better they did in school down the track.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So mums and dads literally build babies\u2019 brains.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We serve, they respond.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "The baby-talk, the silly faces, the chatter even when we know they can\u2019t answer back.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "The closeness of contact \u2013 strengthening that lifelong emotional bond between mother and baby.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "This all matters so much for child development: the biological power of love, trust and security.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And yes, while bad habits can be passed on to children, we know too that the secret ingredients for a good life character, delayed gratification, grit, resilience, they can be taught by parents, not just caught from them.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So I believe if we are going to extend life chances in our country, it\u2019s time to begin talking properly about parenting and babies and reinforcing what a huge choice having a child is in the first place, as well as what a big responsibility parents face in getting these early years right.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Of course, that must begin by helping those most in need.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "That\u2019s why I\u2019ve made it such a priority to speed up the adoption process and improve child protection and social services.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "I think these will be landmark reforms of the next 5 years.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But there\u2019s a lot more we can do.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Our Troubled Families programme has worked with 120,000 of the hardest to reach families in the country, helping turn their lives round, by getting parents a job or the child into school and ending truancy, dealing with the problems that they face.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Over the next 5 years, we will work with 400,000 more families.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "As we do that, I want us to be much bolder.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "It\u2019s tragic that some children turn up to school unable to feed themselves or use the toilet.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Of course this is a clear failure of parenting, but by allowing poor parenting to do such damage for so long, it is also state failure of social services, of the health service, of childcare \u2013 of the lot.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So I can announce today as we scale up the Troubled Families programme, we\u2019ll ensure that parenting skills and child development become central to how it is both targeted and how it is delivered.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "In the end though, getting parenting and the early years right isn\u2019t just about the hardest-to-reach families, frankly it\u2019s about everyone.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We all have to work at it.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And if you don\u2019t have a strong support network \u2013 if you don\u2019t know other mums or dads having your first child can be enormously isolating.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "As we know, they don\u2019t come with a manual and that\u2019s obvious, but is it right that all of us get so little guidance? We\u2019ve made progress.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We\u2019ve dramatically expanded the number of health visitors, and that is crucial.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But it deals with one particular part of parenting \u2013 the first few weeks and months.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "What about later on, when it comes to good play, communication, behaviour, discipline?\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We all need more help with this \u2013 because the most important job we\u2019ll ever have.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So I believe we now need to think about how to make it normal \u2013 even aspirational to attend parenting classes.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We should encourage the growth of high-quality courses that help with all aspects of becoming a great mum or a great dad.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And we need to take steps to encourage all new parents to build a strong network, just as brilliant organisations like Family Action or NCT already do for some parents.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So I can announce today that our Life Chances Strategy will include a plan for significantly expanding parenting provision.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "It will examine the possibility of introducing a voucher scheme for parenting classes and recommend the best way to incentivise parents to take them up.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "**Education**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Now if families fail, it is even more critical that schools do not \u2013 and that of course is the second part of our strategy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "When a child has had a difficult start, what could they need more than a place of sanctuary, warmth, challenge, escape, liberation and discovery?\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Now if they\u2019re lucky, they can find it in an outstanding school with dedicated, inspiring teachers.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
