        "Seven years ago, in my first PMQs, a Conservative Prime Minister told me to stop \u201cgriping\u201d and \u201cget behind\u201d his rail investment plans. A few weeks ago, the new Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said that there \u201cwasn\u2019t really much point\u201d in going ahead with Northern Powerhouse Rail. Time and again, Tory Prime Ministers have promised NPR only to break their promises. Will the Deputy Prime Minister now put on the record whether he supports Transport for the North\u2019s preferred option for NPR, with a stop in Bradford?\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

We are committed to the project; the precise details will be set out in due course.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
