        "\u2026and I want to thank everyone here for the great week we\u2019ve had.",
        "When we came to office, we faced a clear and daunting task: to turn our country around.",
        "In May 2010, the needle on the gauge was at crisis point.",
        "People were talking about this country in a way they had not done for decades.",
        "But three and a half years later, we are beginning to turn the corner.",
        "The deficit is falling.",
        "Our economy is growing.",
        "The numbers of our fellow countrymen and women in work are rising.",
        "We are not there yet, not by a long way.",

        "You. The British people.",
        "Never giving up. Working those extra hours. Coping with those necessary cuts.",
        "You. British business. You kept people on in the hard times. Invested before you knew for certain that things were getting better.",
        "Together \u2013 we are clearing up the mess that Labour left.",
        "But I have a simple question, to the people in this hall and beyond it.",
        "Is that enough?",
        "Is it enough that we just clear up Labour\u2019s mess and think \u2018job done\u2019?",
        "Is it enough to just fix what went wrong?",
        "I say \u2013 no. Not for me.",
        "This isn\u2019t job done; it is job begun.",
        "I didn\u2019t come into politics just to fix what went wrong, but to build something right.",

        "You\u2019ll never be able to veto an EU treaty.",
        "You\u2019ll never cut the Budget.",
        "And if you did these things \u2013 you\u2019d have no allies in Europe.",
        "Well we\u2019ve proved them wrong.",

        "\u2026and yes \u2013 I cut that budget.",
        "And in doing all this, we haven\u2019t lost respect \u2013 we\u2019ve won allies to get powers back from Europe.",

        "\u2026and at the end of it \u2013 yes \u2013 we will give the British people their say in a referendum.",

        "The biggest Budget deficit in our peace-time history.",

        "Yes, they were famously \u201cintensely relaxed\u201d about people getting filthy rich\u2026",

        "**OUR MISSION**",
        "These past few years have been a real struggle.",
        "But what people want to know now is: was the struggle worth it?",
        "And here\u2019s the honest answer.",
        "The struggle will only be worth it if we as a country finish the job we\u2019ve started.",
        "Finishing the job means understanding this.",
        "Our economy may be turning the corner \u2013 and of course that\u2019s great.",
        "But we still haven\u2019t finished paying for Labour\u2019s Debt Crisis.",
        "If anyone thinks that\u2019s over, done, dealt with \u2013 they\u2019re living in a fantasy land.",
        "This country\u2019s debt crisis, created by Labour, is not over.",

        "We are still spending more than we earn.",
        "We still need to earn more and yes, our Government still needs to spend less.",
        "I see that Labour have stopped talking about the debt crisis and now they talk about the cost of living crisis.",
        "As if one wasn\u2019t directly related to the other.",

        "\u2026and how it affects the cost of living\u2026",
        "\u2026just go and ask the Greeks.",
        "So finishing the job means sticking to our course until we\u2019ve paid off all of Labour\u2019s deficit, not just some of it.",
        "And yes \u2013 let\u2019s run a surplus so that this time we fix the roof when the sun is shining\u2026",
        "\u2026as George said in that brilliant speech on Monday.",
        "To abandon deficit reduction now would throw away all the progress we\u2019ve made.",
        "It would put us back to square one.",
        "Unbelievably, that\u2019s exactly what Labour now want to do.",
        "How did they get us into this mess?",
        "Too much spending, too much borrowing, too much debt.",
        "And what did they propose last week?",
        "More spending, more borrowing, more debt.",
        "They have learned nothing \u2013 literally nothing \u2013 from the crisis they created.",
        "But finishing the job is about more than clearing up the mess we were left.",
        "It means building something better in its place.",
        "In place of the casino economy, one where people who work hard can actually get on",
        "In place of the welfare society, one where no individual is written off.",
        "In place of the broken education system, one that gives every child the chance to rise up and succeed.",

        "\u2026all reformed, all rebuilt \u2013 with one aim, one mission in mind:",
        "To make this country, at long last and for the first time ever, a land of opportunity for all.",
        "For all.",
        "So it makes no difference whether you live in the North or in the South, whether you\u2019re black or you\u2019re white, a man or a woman, the school you went to, the background you have, who your parents were\u2026",
        "\u2026what matters is the effort you put in, and if you put the effort in you\u2019ll have the chance to make it.",
        "That\u2019s what the land of opportunity means.",
        "That\u2019s what finishing the job means.",
        "Of course I know that others in politics may talk about these things.",
        "But wishing for something, caring about something \u2013 that\u2019s not enough.",
        "You can\u2019t conjure up a dynamic economy, a strong society, fantastic schools all with the stroke of a minister\u2019s pen.",
        "It takes a mixture of hard work, common sense and \u2013 above all \u2013 the right values.",
        "When the left say: you can\u2019t expect too much from the poorest kids; don\u2019t ask too much from people on welfare; business is the problem, not the solution\u2026",
        "\u2026Here in this party we say: that\u2019s just wrong.",
        "If you expect nothing of people that does nothing for them.",
        "Yes, you must help people \u2013 but you help people by putting up ladders that they can climb through their own efforts.",
        "You don\u2019t help children succeed by dumbing down education\u2026",
        "\u2026you help them by pushing them hard.",
        "Good education is not about equality of outcomes but bringing the best out of every single child.",
        "You don\u2019t help people by leaving them stuck on welfare\u2026",
        "\u2026but by helping them stand on their own two feet.",
        "Why? Because the best way out of poverty is work \u2013 and the dignity that brings.",
        "We know that profit, wealth creation, tax cuts, enterprise\u2026",
        "\u2026these are not dirty, elitist words \u2013 they\u2019re not the problem\u2026",
        "\u2026they really are the solution because it\u2019s not government that creates jobs, it\u2019s businesses\u2026",
        "\u2026it\u2019s businesses that get wages in people\u2019s pockets, food on their tables, hope for their families and success for our country.",
        "There is no shortcut to a land of opportunity. No quick fix. No easy way to do it.",
        "You build it business by business, school by school, person by person\u2026",
        "\u2026patiently, practically, painstakingly.",
        "And underpinning it all is that deep, instinctive belief that if you trust people and give them the tools, they will succeed.",
        "This party at its heart is about big people, strong communities, responsible businesses, a bigger society \u2013 not a bigger state.",
        "It\u2019s how we\u2019ve been clearing up the mess.",
        "And it\u2019s how we\u2019re going to build something better in its place.",
        "So let\u2019s stick with it and finish the job we\u2019ve started.",
        "**ECONOMY**",
        "A land of opportunity starts in our economy.",
        "The chance to get a decent job. To start a business. To own a home.",
        "And at the end of it all \u2013 more money in your pocket.",
        "To get decent jobs for people, you\u2019ve got to recognise some fundamental economic facts.",
        "We are in a global race today. No one owes us a living.",
        "Last week, our ambition to compete in the global race was airily dismissed as a race to the bottom\u2026",
        "\u2026that it means competing with China on sweatshops and India on low wages.",
        "No \u2013 those countries are becoming our customers\u2026",
        "\u2026and we\u2019ve got to compete with California on innovation; Germany on high-end manufacturing; Asia on finance and technology.",
        "And here\u2019s something else you need to recognise about this race.",
        "The plain fact is this.",
        "All those global companies that employ lots of people \u2013 they can set up anywhere in the world.",
        "They could go to Silicon Valley. To Berlin.",
        "And yes, here in Manchester.",
        "And these companies base their decisions on some simple things: like the tax rates in each country.",
        "So if those taxes are higher here than elsewhere, they don\u2019t come here.",
        "And if they don\u2019t come here, we don\u2019t get those jobs.",
        "Do you get that, Labour?",
        "British people don\u2019t get those jobs.",
        "Last week Labour proposed to put up corporation tax on our biggest and most successful employers.",
        "That is just about the most damaging, nonsensical, twisted economic policy you could possibly come up with.",
        "I get to visit some amazing factories in my job.",
        "One of my favourites is Jaguar Land Rover\u2026",
        "\u2026not just because they actually let me get in a car and drive it around on my own\u2026",

        "\u2026the fact that what they\u2019re making sells around the world \u2013 the best of British design and engineering.",
        "So when Ed Miliband talks about the face of big business, I think about the faces of these hardworking people.",
        "Labour is saying to their employers: \u201cwe want to put up your taxes\u2026 don\u2019t come here \u2013 stick your jobs and take them elsewhere\u201d.",
        "I know that bashing business might play to a Labour audience.",
        "But it\u2019s crazy for our country.",
        "So if Labour\u2019s plan for jobs is to attack business \u2013 ours is to back business.",
        "Regulation \u2013 down. Taxes \u2013 cut for businesses large and small. A new industrial policy that looks to the future \u2013 green jobs, aerospace jobs, life science jobs.",
