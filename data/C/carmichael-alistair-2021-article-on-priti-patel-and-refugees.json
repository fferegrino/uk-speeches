        "Priti Patel says refugees should come to the UK through safe and legal routes, and is threatening to punish any who don\u2019t.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "But at the same time, the Conservative Government is failing to provide any safe and legal routes for refugees to take.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "The Government\u2019s latest figures show that just 353 refugees were resettled in the UK in 2020-21 \u2013 a drop of 93% since the previous year.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "The UK has a proud history of providing sanctuary to those in need, but now the Conservatives are turning their backs on refugees.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Their failure to provide safe and legal routes is pushing desperate, vulnerable people into the hands of people smugglers and human traffickers.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Priti Patel\u2019s tough rhetoric and cruel policies only increases their profit margins. \u201cWe thank your government for our full pockets,\u201d one smuggler told the Guardian recently.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "That\u2019s why the Liberal Democrats are calling on the Government to make an ambitious, ten-year commitment to resettle 10,000 vulnerable refugees a year from Syria and other dangerous conflict areas. Because that\u2019s how we will actually combat these criminal gangs and prevent people from making dangerous attempts to cross the Channel and the Mediterranean.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And what about the people who do come to the UK seeking sanctuary, having left their homes fleeing war or prosecution? They should be welcomed with compassion, not kept in limbo for months while their claims are processed.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Those same statistics reveal that 50,084 asylum seekers have been waiting more than six months for a decision from the Home Office \u2013 a number that has doubled on Priti Patel\u2019s watch. That\u2019s the scandal she should be tackling, but none of her endless series of cruel proposals will actually help solve it. In fact, they\u2019ll just cause even longer delays.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "The Home Office is clearly not fit for purpose. So instead of making it harder for refugees to claim asylum, let\u2019s take these decisions away from the Home Office altogether.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "A new arms-length, non-political agency should take over, with the staff, training and resources to process applications quickly, decide cases fairly, and get them right first time. And let\u2019s finally lift the ban and give asylum seekers the right to work. They should be enabled to contribute to our society, not trapped for months on just \u00a35.66 a day.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Liberal Democrats are fighting to fix the broken asylum system, so that everyone can have confidence in it, and everyone\u2019s rights and dignity are respected.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals"
