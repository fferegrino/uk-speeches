    "summary": "The parliamentary question asked by Ruth Cadbury, the Labour MP for Brentford and Isleworth, in the House of Commons on 6 December 2022.",
    "content": [
        "**Ruth Cadbury (Brentford and Isleworth) (Lab)**",
        "What progress his Department has made on its commitment to recruit 6,000 additional GPs by 2024.",
        "**The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care (Steve Barclay)**",
        "In September 2022 there were nearly 2,300 more full-time equivalent doctors in general practice than there were at the same time in 2019, and more than 9,000 GP trainees.",
        "**Ruth Cadbury**",
        "A constituent of mine, a full-time GP in her 50s, told me that the pension rules mean she has to retire, work part-time or emigrate, which is hardly likely to help her patients to obtain appointments with her. Having hinted at a change in doctors\u2019 pension rules last summer, the Government are only now announcing a consultation that will last until next spring, so there will be no change in these crazy rules until next summer at the earliest. Is this not too little, too late?",
        "**Steve Barclay**",
        "It is worth reminding the House that there are 3% more doctors this year than last year. As I have said, we have 2,300 more full-time GPs, and we are recruiting more. However, the hon. Lady is absolutely right about doctors\u2019 pensions; that is a material issue, which is why we launched the consultation, and we are working with Treasury colleagues to address these concerns as quickly as possible."
