        "**Question**",
        "Prime Minister, first of all thank you so much for coming today to the FSB\u2019s first policy conference. Your clear commitment to engaging with us and with small firms is fantastic to see. We very much welcomed the announcement at the Autumn Statement of the support you\u2019re giving for business rates, but day in, day out, our members are still telling us that that is the biggest problem that they face going forwards. With 7% of small firms paying more in rates than rent, will you finally tackle this by looking at how you could ensure a complete reform occurs?",
        "**Answer**",
        "Thank you. Well, first of all, thank you very much for the welcome.",
        "On business rates, let me just first of all state a truism, but it is important with all of this. Whatever tax we\u2019re looking at that we don\u2019t like \u2013 and frankly, I don\u2019t really like any taxes \u2013 but whatever tax it is, there is one truism, which is: you can only get taxes down or keep taxes down if you\u2019re prepared to make difficult decisions about spending. [Political content removed]",
        "On business rates, I completely recognise what you say. It is, I think, businesses\u2019 \u2013 particularly small businesses\u2019 \u2013 number one complaint. We tried to address it in the Autumn Statement with, I think, a reasonable package; by capping the increase at 2%, by the \u00a31,000 rebate, particularly for the retail and restaurant premises on the high street that I think have been really hit by the internet shopping revolution; and obviously we\u2019ve extended the small business relate \u2013 relief scheme.",
        "I think we do need to look at longer-term reform. It\u2019s not going to be easy, because rates raise, whatever it is \u2013 around \u00a324 billion \u2013 and I don\u2019t think there is any one solution that is going to make everybody happy. But I think we\u2019ve got to start addressing this issue and understanding \u2013 particularly this issue about internet retailing and high-street retailing. I\u2019m passionate about our high-streets. I represent some lovely market towns in Oxfordshire. They\u2019re doing pretty well, actually, because they\u2019ve kept free parking \u2013 they haven\u2019t made that mistake \u2013 and they\u2019ve encouraged big retailers into the centre of town and made space available. But it\u2019s going to be a growing issue, and I think it needs more work \u2013 I agree with you, sir.",
        "**Question**",
        "You\u2019re asking us what you can do for us. I have one request, please. As regards the banks, could you please ask the credit rating system to be changed? For my personal business is actually doing really very well, but my own private, personal credit rating is poor because I\u2019ve had a business failure in the past. In America they celebrate business failure \u2013 you\u2019re not counted as a business unless you\u2019ve had numerous failures behind you. In this country, as soon as you fail in a business, you have a poor personal credit rating \u2013 doesn\u2019t matter how well your business is doing, you cannot get assistance financially.",
        "**Answer**",
        "I think it\u2019s a very good point. I think it\u2019s a cultural point here, which, as you say, in America, serial entrepreneurship, where not every step works out, is not seen as a disaster; it\u2019s seen as a learning process, and that\u2019s what brave entrepreneurs do. And I think we need to change the culture here, so we celebrate that sort of buccaneering style as well. I think that\u2019s the first point.",
        "On the banks I think it has probably, along with the rating system, been the number one small business complaint. When I look at the overall figures now for gross lending to small businesses, there does seem to be some improvement, but I\u2019m still hearing too many stories of people being asked for personal guarantees and putting their flat or their house on the line to get the loan. Whenever I get them, I follow them up, often individually with the bank concerned to get to the bottom of why these practices are still being followed.",
        "Your point about personal credit ratings \u2013 I\u2019d like to take that one away. I\u2019ve got my top team from the Number 10 policy unit sitting here. We\u2019ve also got Lex Greenhill \u2013 Lex, where are you? Give us a wave. Thank you very much. Lex is sorting out the whole supply chain finance issue for us, which is often a very good way of small businesses helping small businesses to get credit and to get a finance when they\u2019re part of a supply chain. So we\u2019re working on the whole solution, but I take your point very much about personal credit ratings too.",
        "**Question**",
        "Prime Minister, you say you believe in a recovery for all. How do you respond to figures today showing 10 times as many jobs are being created in London as elsewhere? And just while I\u2019m on the capital, how do you respond to Boris Johnson\u2019s call to further reduce the top rate of tax?",
        "**Answer**",
        "Well first of all, on the issue of job figures, if you actually take the last 2 years \u2013 so, up to the present day \u2013 we\u2019ve created \u2013 the last million jobs created, three quarters of them were created outside London. So, look, if I look across the country, do I want to see even more growth and even more jobs in our regions? Yes I do. We\u2019ve got to work even harder to get a really balanced recovery? Yes, of course we have. But actually, employment has grown in every region of our country, and actually the second fastest\u2011growing region in terms of jobs outside London is Yorkshire and the Humberside.",
        "So we need to make sure that happens, and we have a plan for making that happen. That\u2019s why we\u2019re building the roads and railways; that\u2019s why we\u2019re investing in the super-fast broadband; that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing city deals with all of the major cities of our country, to make sure we scour Whitehall for every scheme and every extra bit of money to try and leverage in jobs and investment in those cities. So we\u2019ve got a plan, we\u2019ve got a programme; I think that plan and programme are working, but we really need to work at making sure this is a balanced recovery across our country.",
        "**Question**",
        "You mentioned something very lightly, which is immigration, and I\u2019m just interested in your comments on what you\u2019re doing with immigration, because public attitudes are tough, public attitudes are anxious, but they\u2019re not anxious about skilled migration, they\u2019re not anxious about business entrepreneurs, they\u2019re not anxious about job creators. And I think with your narrative about the global race, I\u2019m just interested in the comment you make, because you said it\u2019s part of your economic plan, but if the public isn\u2019t anxious about international students and these job creators, then don\u2019t you think that your policies on the business side are actually at risk of damaging our economic growth and our recovery?",
        "**Answer**",
        "What I would say is I think public attitudes on immigration are sensible and well-informed. The British public recognises the fact that there has been very large, large-scale immigration over recent years, and politicians have not properly addressed this. In fact, in some circumstances, like the decision in 2004 to allow unfettered access to British markets of the 8 countries who then joined the European Union, actually made the situation worse. And the public, I don\u2019t think, are being at all unreasonable in saying can we please have a government and can we have a Prime Minister who takes this issue seriously and puts in place a proper balanced and sensible immigration system? And that is exactly what I\u2019m doing.",
        "And I make it part of my economic plan for this reason. Immigration policy on its own is not really worth very much. What you need is an immigration policy \u2013 proper controls on who\u2019s allowed to come and work and live here \u2013 you need to combine that with a proper welfare policy, so it pays to work rather than stay on welfare, with a proper education policy, so we are training young people to be able to do the jobs that are becoming available. They are 3 sides of the same policy. So if we have proper immigration control, a proper skills and education policy, and welfare reform so that work pays, I believe we\u2019ll see levels of migration fall, we\u2019ll see net migration come back to the 10s of thousands, where it was in the 1980s, which also the benefit of immigration not being an issue in public life, which I would very much like that to be the case again.",
        "Now, taking your specific points on business and skills and education, I would challenge the point that the government has done anything that would disadvantage those areas. Actually, because we have dealt with the bogus colleges that weren\u2019t really there to provide training courses; they were there as a back door for immigration \u2013 because we\u2019ve closed down those bogus colleges, we\u2019ve actually been able to say a very clear thing to our universities and to students from overseas, which is: there\u2019s no limit on the number of students who can come to the UK; you just need a university place and an English language course. So our universities can get out and market themselves around the world, as well as providing great education for our young people.",
        "To business we said: of course we don\u2019t want to disadvantage business by having an immigration policy that damages you. Yes, we\u2019re going to put a cap in place on the number of economic migrants from outside the EU, because it doesn\u2019t make sense to have that uncapped. But we\u2019re going to make sure that things like inter-company transfers that we\u2019re very flexible about. And so I haven\u2019t actually had a stream of businesses coming to my door complaining about our immigration policy, and as soon as they hear it\u2019s tied to reform of education and reform of welfare, they can see you\u2019ve got a sensible, joined-up government, delivering the British people\u2019s priorities.",
        "And as I say, I think the public\u2019s attitudes on immigration \u2013 they\u2019re not about race; they\u2019re not about culture. It\u2019s purely about numbers and pressure and making sure we grip this properly, and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m committed to doing.",
        "**Question**",
        "I\u2019m delighted to say that you\u2019re going to get out of the way and you\u2019re going to stand up for us and celebrate what we do. In standing up for us, can I ask you to put more pressure on making broadband the fourth utility?",
        "**Answer**",
        "Yes. Well, it is. I mean, you\u2019re absolutely \u2013 \u2018the fourth utility\u2019 is a great phrase for it. If you are a business in rural Britain, a high\u2011speed broadband connection is as important as a good train service or a good rail service or a good road. It is going to be the way that businesses communicate and succeed for the future. I represent a largely rural constituency. Amongst small businesses, rural businesses it is the issue. It\u2019s not one of many issues; it\u2019s absolutely the issue.",
        "Now, I think if we are fair to Broadband UK, British Telecom, the Departure for Culture, Media and Sport, the money\u2019s going in, the deals are being signed. I think there are 10,000 businesses being signed up every week, but it is always difficult getting to that last 5, 10%. The money\u2019s there to help us do that. We\u2019re going to have to be very technically savvy. It\u2019s good that we\u2019ve hired the former head of British Telecom to come and be our Trade Minister because I can, every now and again, get a little bit of inside advice from him about how we get this to go faster. So we\u2019re totally committed to it and we think we will have the best broadband network in Europe, but we\u2019re going to have to be very creative for the last 5 or 10%.",
        "**Question**",
        "My own business is involved in business advice and employment law and I also chair the FSB\u2019s Employment Policy Committee. The Chancellor\u2019s comments on the National Minimum Wage evoked quite a bit of interest a few days ago and I wondered what your views are, particularly in terms of the concerns that relate to job creation or the problems that it will cause in particular sectors, like the care sector.",
        "**Answer**",
        "Well, you\u2019ll be relieved to know my views are the same as the Chancellor\u2019s. [Political content removed] I think the key is this: I think the National Minimum Wage has been a success. I think it\u2019s been successful in part because of the role played by the Low Pay Commission, but I think it\u2019s very important to listen to what they say about what is sustainable for the level of the minimum wage. The facts, though, are these: obviously, the minimum wage lost some of its value during the great recession when the Low Pay Commission didn\u2019t advise putting it up or putting it up by very much and so we have seen an erosion in its value. Under this government it\u2019s gone up by 10%, but if it had its value restored in full, we\u2019d have a \u00a37 minimum wage rather than a \u00a36.30 minimum wage.",
        "Now, as I said the other day on a television or radio interview, I can\u2019t remember which, I\u2019d love to be Prime Minister of a country that could afford a \u00a37 minimum wage; I think it would be a great step forward. But we have to let the Low Pay Commission do their work and we should listen to them about we don\u2019t want to do things that will destroy jobs. The job creation of the record of this government is something I\u2019m very, very proud of: 1.3 million more people in work, record numbers in work.",
        "So I hope it will be possible to start restoring the value of the minimum wage. I think we need to listen to the Low Pay Commission, but surely as the country becomes better off as our economy grows, we should be able to afford those increases. But it will be for the Low Pay Commission to advise the government and I think it would be good if, in our country, we don\u2019t make the minimum wage a sort of political football and we try and listen to the Low Pay Commission and let them play the vital role of referee. That\u2019s the key.",
        "One last thing. Of course, as well as seeing the minimum wage go up 10% under this government, because we\u2019ve cut income tax, because you can now earn \u00a310,000 before paying income tax, that is equivalent of another 10% on the minimum wage. So we\u2019ve been focused on how to help low earners and I think that\u2019s the right focus to have.",
        "**Question**",
        "If you\u2019ll forgive me, I\u2019m going to remind you of the second of my colleague\u2019s questions. She asked you whether you agreed with Boris Johnson, as a tax\u2011cutting Tory, that you wanted to cut the top rate of tax to 40p.",
        "My question now, if I may, which is: you said this morning that immigration from Romania and Bulgaria was reasonable. How do you know and what you do mean by \u2018reasonable\u2019?",
        "**Answer**",
        "We\u2019ve cut the top rate of tax from \u00a30.50 to \u00a30.45. I think it was the right step to take. I always knew it wouldn\u2019t be particularly popular, but I thought it was the right thing to do, because I want to take steps in this country that are going to encourage investment, going to encourage jobs, going to encourage growth, going to encourage business to invest more [Political content removed]. It is an anti\u2011business, anti\u2011enterprise, anti\u2011growth measure and I would argue, just as what I think George Osborne and I did was right for the economy but politically difficult, [Political content removed]",
        "As for future rates of tax, they are, as the saying goes, a matter for the Chancellor in his budget and I think I will rest with that. But it is important always to think about \u2013 taxes are about how you raise the money. You should think about the revenue. I want rich people to pay more taxes. The way to get rich people to pay more tax is to get the economy moving, to get them investing, to get them spending, to get them buying, to get them employing and, actually, we\u2019re seeing the rich paying more in income tax in every year under this government than in any year under the last government.",
        "Immigration, Romania and Bulgaria, the point I was making on the radio this morning is obviously 1st January has passed and that\u2019s an important milestone. We extended the transitional controls from 5 years to 7 years; we\u2019re not able to extend them further. There aren\u2019t any official statistics. I haven\u2019t been looking at unofficial statistics, but just from what I read and see and hear, as you have, I think that these numbers look, as I said this morning, reasonable.",
        "**Question**",
        "We\u2019re an online marketplace for business loans and our technology means that businesses can typically get finance from our investors within 2 weeks, and you mentioned challenger banks. Obviously it\u2019s great to hear that you\u2019re advocating more competition within the sector, but it would also be good to hear what you think about alternative models within the wider landscape.",
        "**Answer**",
        "Yes. I\u2019m very keen on these new models, a lot of which are using internet online technology, crowd sourcing in order to help people to fund their businesses. Obviously it\u2019s been frustrating that the banks haven\u2019t been lending more to small businesses. I think the big picture numbers now show a more helpful pattern in terms of gross lending, but I think these other ways of raising finance are incredibly encouraging.",
        "And we should do our bit to help with that. That\u2019s what the Business Bank is about that the government has set up and funded, that\u2019s what the Start\u2011Up Loans are about and I think we should be as flexible as we can to try and find new ways of encouraging people to invest. That\u2019s what all our enterprise relief schemes are about. The EIS scheme is about getting money into small businesses.",
        "I keep asking investors, \u2018Is there anything else we can do to make this work better?\u2019 and people seem pretty happy with the way it\u2019s working. But if people have got specific suggestions for how we help fund small business, how we help entrepreneurs, how we deal with the difficult stages afterwards \u2013 the so\u2011called \u2018valley of death\u2019 \u2013 Tim Luke and Daniel Korski from the Policy Unit are at the front; all ideas gratefully received.",
        "**Question**",
        "I own my own engineering company and I\u2019d like to know do you have any plans to further assist manufacturing. I would say that manufacturing went into recession in 2006, before the bank crisis struck. Here we are 7 years later, nothing has been done about training in those years in the meantime, and the clothes you are wearing today were made on a machine, if someone\u2019s not out there making those machines we\u2019re going to have nothing. Manufacturing desperately needs help.",
        "**Answer**",
        "Right, okay. Well, look, the good news, sir, is that the last figures that we have for the British economy, manufacturing has been growing actually slightly faster than services and I think it\u2019s welcome that we\u2019re seeing a recovery in manufacturing, in construction as well as in our service industries. I think what we also need to see is that export growth and manufacturing obviously, as a very tradable sector, is always a vital part of that.",
        "What can the government do for manufacturing? I think there are 3 or 4 things that are vital. There\u2019s obviously the tax regime that affects lots of businesses, so low corporate tax rates. We\u2019ve got the Patent Box, so if you invent anything here in Britain and manufacture it here in Britain you pay 10% corporation tax. I think the apprenticeship schemes that we\u2019re backing, record funding going into apprenticeship schemes. I think that\u2019s particularly important for manufacturing and those sorts of skilled jobs. I think the transport network \u2013 we talked about broadband is vital for a lot of rural businesses; if you\u2019re a manufacturing business we need to upgrade our ports, we need to upgrade our railways and our roads, all of which is happening.",
        "I think that the other piece of the jigsaw I\u2019ve mentioned is these catapult centres that the business department is setting up, where we\u2019re looking at specific industries, specific parts of manufacturing and thinking how can we help by, frankly, imitating the Germans and seeing where you can get the best out of our universities, the best out of our business brains, and put them together in catapult centres to try and literally catapult better technology into our manufacturing industries. So, for instance, the one that we\u2019re doing with aerospace, which is funded with hundreds of millions of pounds, I think could be a real success in an area where Britain is still the number 2 in the world.",
        "So I\u2019m very much committed to a manufacturing based recovery, to supporting manufacturers, I think sills, technology, taxes and transport were the ones I\u2019d put at the top of the list, but if you\u2019ve got other ones, my experts here in the front row, and you can have a go at them after I\u2019ve gone.",
        "**Question**",
        "I started out when I was 12, I was one of very few number. Obviously I think now we can all say that the age of the entrepreneur really has arrived, and of course the enterprise loans are actually sitting here with Mike and Ben Dyer who are the only young entrepreneur delivery partners for the enterprise loans who are actually giving me a loan at the moment.",
        "So, I think we can certainly say that the age has arrived, the only thing that worries me slightly is \u2013 particularly within my industry of food and drink, high end retail \u2013 is that that the industry is so crowded, and retail has been so badly damaged through the recession, is that sustainable? Is it sustainable for 12,000 new businesses to be setting up when we go into a retail that 2 brands have to come out for us to go in?",
        "That\u2019s the first point, and then the second one is to do with export, so sort of following on from that. We\u2019ve been exporting \u2013 I\u2019ve worked with UKTI for a number of years; I was at the November 2010 event as a speaker. And what we see is an inconsistency on what\u2019s actually being talked about in terms of the support of trade and export. Very quick example, we exported to Mexico, we were told and advised by UK Trade & Investment we\u2019d need a dairy certification. Products arrived into port and were held by customs; we had to pay nearly \u00a38,000 for a new certification because dairy isn\u2019t required.",
        "So I think there\u2019s a little bit of an inconsistency there with what\u2019s being sort of discussed and what\u2019s actually being delivered. So I please ask you that you could talk to UK Trade & Investment to actually engage more with people who are on the forefront of export.",
        "**Answer**",
        "Okay. Well thank you very much and thank you for what you\u2019ve done since the age of 12 to deliver this enterprise revolution. I mean, I really believe it is happening. When I see what\u2019s happening with the start-up loans, with the enterprise allowance scheme, with the fact here are 400,000 more businesses today than there were 3 and a half years ago in our country, I think we are seeing real signs of an enterprise economy bursting through again.",
        "On UKTI, I think the performance has improved a lot over recent years, but one of the reasons for hiring a great business brain, in Livingston, is to really put him to work on turning around this organisation even more, and making sure it\u2019s looking after small businesses in particular. I think a lot of big businesses already have the expertise in terms of export and how to get on in overseas markets, but small businesses really need that help and support.",
        "On your point on retail, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve got a really good answer to that. I mean, you know, we have a very competitive retail market. I mean, when Napoleon said we\u2019re a nation of shopkeepers he meant it as an insult, I take it as a compliment, and I think we should want to have a competitive market where new people should break through. And that\u2019s the business world we live in today. You know, you think about it, a few years ago a lot of these brands that have gone global or taking over the world didn\u2019t even exist. You know, where was Skype 5 years ago? You know where were some of these businesses that have come from nowhere? So I think we should celebrate the fact that we have a lot of bursting\u2011through small businesses that are going to change their markets, because it\u2019s that process of change that will create the jobs of the future.",
        "**Question**",
        "I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s a bit about the banks. It\u2019s an ask for a little bit of help. We\u2019ve been very lucky in 2 of my members, we\u2019ve managed to get recompense from the banks for the mis-selling of swap rates. And these are microbusinesses, \u00a3120,000 worth of extra interest. They\u2019ve now been given, eventually, their compensation package, which includes about a quarter of an inch of paper to go through. Inside there is a confidentiality clause; we can argue about that.",
        "But the big problem being is that the answer in short terms is, \u2018Yes we got it wrong. Here\u2019s your money back. Here\u2019s the compensation we think we\u2019ll give you. And if you don\u2019t like it, you can reapply to us, but be aware that you might not get back what we\u2019ve offered you in the first place.\u2019 And I think that\u2019s completely wrong. If the compensation isn\u2019t enough, the person should be able to go back without fear of losing the initial claim \u2013 or we need something to do about that. And just to add insult to injury, the following day, they got a telephone call from that bank saying, \u2018We got it wrong before but can we re-do your loan for you?\u2019",
        "**Answer**",
        "Right. But I think that \u2013 that\u2019s a good one to end on sir. Look, I think our banking system is strengthening. I think our banking system is being sorted out. But it\u2019s going to take more time. And I think the 2 key elements that you\u2019re pointing to are, 1, we need more competition. Banks have got to feel the pressure of competition, from the fact that business owners can take their custom somewhere else. They\u2019ve got to feel the pressure that account holders can switch their account to another bank. That is now happening, and I think these challenger banks that you can now see \u2013 the Metro Banks, the Handelsbanks, the fact that TSB is out there again \u2013 that competition, we need that to change the culture and the practice in banking.",
        "The second area is regulation, and I think, frankly, we did inherit a bit of a mess in terms of regulation, and we\u2019ve taken steps to sort that out by giving the Bank of England an absolutely clear role in terms of calling the time on excessive debt in our economy, which it didn\u2019t do previously. But also having in the Financial Conduct Authority a tough and rigorous regulator on banking practice.",
        "And so this is not going to be easily fixed. I would just beware the sort of quack remedies that I think we\u2019re being offered by the opposition, who come up with something that looks flashy for about a day, and then you realise hasn\u2019t worked elsewhere in the world and is not right. I think under this government you can see the competition is hotting up. The new banks are arriving. There\u2019s more work to be done as we nurse RBS back to health. And let\u2019s let these new regulators get on with their job, and they may be able to look at cases like your \u2013 the one you mention, and make sure that we police these organisations better.",
        "Can I thank you very much indeed. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m told that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got time for. Can I thank you very much for inviting me. Sorry it\u2019s taken 40 years to get a prime minister along, but, as I said, we\u2019ll try and speed up the next \u2013 the next arrival \u2013 of this prime minister, let me just be clear about that, in case there are any doubts about that one. But thank you very much for the warm welcome. Thank you for the suggestions.",
        "This is about not just a speech and a Q&A; it\u2019s about a process of engagement. We desperately want small business, enterprise and entrepreneurship to succeed in our country. There\u2019s some stuff we need to get out the way: the tax and regulation. There\u2019s some big stuff we need to stand up for on small business. And there\u2019s a bit more celebrating we need to do of successful enterprise and entrepreneurship, and people who create wealth and jobs in our economy. It is a vital piece of work. It\u2019s an incredibly noble thing to do when people start out on their own. And when they create those businesses that become great employers of the future, it is a genuine public service, and we can\u2019t say that often enough.",
        "Thank you very much indeed."
