        "Three years ago \u2013 nearly three and a half \u2013 I walked into the Cabinet Office for my first day as Deputy Prime Minister.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Picture it: history in the making as a Liberal Democrat leader entered, finally, into the corridors of power, preparing to unshackle Britain after years of Labour and Conservative rule. Only to arrive and find an empty room and one shell-shocked civil servant promising me we\u2019d get on with things shortly \u2013 but first he had to get us some desks.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "You saw the calm bit in the rose garden. What you didn\u2019t see was the utter chaos indoors. To say the Coalition caught Whitehall off guard is a massive understatement. The Government machine had no idea how it was going to handle power sharing \u2013 and not just the furniture, this was going to need a complete overhaul of how decisions would be taken and departments would be run. And \u2013 while no one really wanted to admit it at the time \u2013 the truth is, no one was quite sure how it was all going to work.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Here we were, this anti-establishment liberal party \u2013 which hadn\u2019t been in power for 70 years \u2013 smack bang in the middle of Her Majesty\u2019s Government: a Government machine built to serve one party, with only one party leader at the centre, now suddenly having to answer to two parties and two party leaders. Alongside us were these Tories, who we had been at war with for the past month \u2013 well, actually, more like the last hundred years.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "The country was deep in economic crisis, in desperate need of stable Government. And the whole thing was set to a soundtrack of pessimism and naysaying: the Liberal Democrats had signed their own death warrant. The Coalition would fall in a matter of months. Britain would be the next Greece.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "So let\u2019s just stop and think about where we are now: The country\u2019s economy growing stronger by the day. Stable, successful coalition \u2013 something that seemed impossible now accepted as the norm. And the Liberal Democrats proving that we can be trusted with the biggest responsibility of all \u2013 fixing the economy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I know how hard it has been getting here \u2013 facing down all the vitriol from our opponents. Trust me, there were days I thanked my lucky stars that my children were too young to understand some of the things that were written and said. But every insult we have had to endure since we entered Government, every snipe, every bad headline, every blow to our support: That was all worth it \u2013 because we are turning Britain around.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "We haven\u2019t won over every critic; we\u2019ll be tested a million more times. But the big question mark that has always hung over the Liberal Democrats \u2013 could we handle Government, and handle it when the going got tough? \u2013 that question mark is now gone. This recovery wouldn\u2019t be happening without us.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "We have made sure the deficit is being cut at the right pace. We were the ones who said you don\u2019t just get growth by cutting red tape \u2013 Government also needs to invest in things: infrastructure, apprenticeships, regional growth.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "So I want you to feel proud today. Feel proud that the country\u2019s fortunes are turning. Feel proud that, when we were under pressure to buckle and change course, we held our nerve. Feel proud that we are right here, in the centre of Government and the centre of British politics, standing up for the millions of people in the middle.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I have talked to you before about our journey from the comforts of opposition to the realities of Government \u2013 but not anymore. Liberal Democrats \u2013 we are a party of Government now. And just think of what we have achieved in three short years.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "For the first time ever, our schools get given money \u2013 our Pupil Premium \u2013 to stop children from the poorest families from falling behind \u2013 the first time ever. More than a million men and women have started training as apprentices \u2013 record numbers. Businesses across every region are being given billions to help them grow.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "We\u2019ve made the biggest investment in our railways since the Victorian times. We\u2019ve created a bank devoted to clean, green industry \u2013 a world first. Elderly people will no longer have to sell their homes to pay for social care because we\u2019ve capped the crippling costs. Mothers will no longer be worse off in retirement because our new simpler, fairer state pension recognises the value of raising a family.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Fathers will have the choice of staying at home once their children are born because we\u2019re transforming parental leave.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "All parents will get free, extra childcare, paid for by the state, when their children turn three or two for the families who need it most. We stopped ID cards. We\u2019ve taken innocent people off the DNA database. We\u2019ve ended child detention in the immigration system. 0.7% of national wealth spent on aid for the world\u2019s poorest \u2013 our party\u2019s policy for years. Not to mention getting the banks in order and helping create over a million new jobs.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And, one last one: at a time when millions of people are feeling the squeeze, when every penny counts, we\u2019ve cut income tax bills by \u00a3700 and taken almost three million people on low pay out of paying any income tax altogether.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "The Tories like to claim credit for that one now, don\u2019t they? But do you remember the TV debates? David Cameron turned to me, in front of the whole country, and said: \u2018I would love to take everyone out of their first \u00a310,000 of income tax Nick, but we cannot afford it\u2019. Well, we can afford it. And we did it. A stronger economy and a fairer society too.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Actually, just one more, and my new favourite: just a few months ago, our Government \u2013 our Government \u2013 passed a law that will make Britain a place where we finally celebrate love and commitment equally between couples whether they are gay or straight: Equal Marriage. Three years. Three years. We\u2019re not even done yet.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Can you imagine what we could do with five more? You should be able to \u2013we\u2019ve spent the last five days talking about it. This whole week has been about looking forward and one thing is very clear: the Liberal Democrats don\u2019t want to go back to the opposition benches, because we aren\u2019t done yet.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Because here\u2019s what\u2019s at stake at the next election: The country is finally emerging from the biggest economic crisis in living memory. The absolute worst thing to do would be to give the keys to Number 10 to a single party Government \u2013 Labour or the Conservatives.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "All of the sacrifices made by the British people \u2013 the pay freezes, the spending cuts, the lost jobs, the daily grind of austerity \u2013 all of that would be for nothing. Labour would wreck the recovery. The Conservatives would give us the wrong kind of recovery. Only the Liberal Democrats can finish the job and finish it in a way that is fair.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "In 2015 the clapped out politics of red, blue, blue red threatens everything we have achieved. But, back in Government \u2013 and next time that will mean back in coalition Government \u2013 the Liberal Democrats can keep the country on the right path.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Imagine the next round of leaders\u2019 debates everyone watching to see who agrees with whom this time. David Cameron will say to Ed Miliband: you\u2019re irresponsible, you are going to drive the economy to ruin. Ed Miliband will say to David Cameron: you can\u2019t be trusted to help everyone, your party only cares about the rich. For once, I will agree with them both. Because they\u2019re both right: left to their own devices, they\u2019ll both get it wrong.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "But, Liberal Democrats, we have learned a lot since getting into Government, and one of the main things I have learnt is this: If we\u2019re asking people to put us back in the room next time round, if we want them to know why it\u2019s better to have us round the table when the big decisions are made, they need to be able to make a judgement about what we\u2019ll do there. And that\u2019s as much about values, character, background as anything else.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "They need to know who we are. Who I am. Why I\u2019m a Liberal Democrat and why I\u2019m standing here today. So, let me start with this: I was part of a generation raised \u2013 in the 70s and 80s \u2013 on a constant diet of aggressive, us-and-them politics.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I have so many memories of my brothers, my sister and I watching television and asking our parents why everyone seemed so upset. Angry, shouty Labour politicians. Union leaders gesticulating furiously, next to pictures of rubbish piling up on the streets. And later: stand offs between crowds of miners and rows of riot police.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "At school I was being taught all about the Cold War \u2013 the backdrop to all of this; I even remember a history teacher telling me and my petrified classmates that we probably wouldn\u2019t make it until Christmas because there was bound to be a Soviet strike. So the world I grew up in was all about stark, polarised choices. Us vs them; East vs West; Left vs Right.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "An incompetent Labour Government had been replaced by a heartless Conservative Government. All anyone seemed to care about was whose side you were on. So I steered clear of party politics.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Then, one day, when I was 22 and studying in America, the phone rang and it was my mum. She had just heard on the News that the Berlin Wall was coming down. So my flatmate and I tuned in our radio, and we sat and listened for hours to reports of people coming out of their homes in the middle of the night and literally hammering away at this symbol of division and hate.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And I can remember so clearly the sense of optimism and hope. Anyone here who\u2019s my age will understand: it really felt as though the dark, drab days of angry politics and conflict could now give way to something better. But, in the weeks and months that followed, when I looked to the Government of my country, the British Government, to see if they were raising their sights to help shape this brave new world.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "All I could see was a bunch of Tories too busy tearing strips off each other \u2013 embroiled, surprise surprise, in rows about European Treaties and widget directives. It was so totally dispiriting: everything I\u2019d come to abhor about the politics with which I\u2019d grown up: insular, petty, polarised.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And if that had been the end of the story, I doubt I would have entered politics at all. But it wasn\u2019t. Enter Paddy Ashdown. I met Paddy, for the first time, when he came into a dingy, grey, bureaucratic office I was working in in Strasbourg. It was the middle of a major trade dispute between America and Europe.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "He marched in, everyone instinctively stood to attention, and in what seemed like the blink of an eye: he ordered a cup of coffee, instructed the room on how to solve the world\u2019s trade wars, issued a series of action points that should have been delivered yesterday, reassured us all it would be alright, and then swept out.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "This was the first time I\u2019d seen a British politician talking with passion and conviction and without defensiveness or fear about the challenges in the world and the leadership Britain needed to show. The Liberal Democrats seemed so outward looking and forward looking, compared to the tired, old, introverted politics of Labour and the Conservatives. For me, that was it. That\u2019s how I found our party.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "So I know what it is like to look at the old parties and want more \u2013 to want a party that speaks for big, enduring values. And what the Liberal Democrats gave me 20 years ago. Showing me there was something better than the tired choice between Labour and the Conservatives is something I want us to give to people across Britain today.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "What do you think Britain would look like today if the Tories had been alone in Whitehall for the last three years? What would have happened without Liberal Democrats in this Government? I haven\u2019t said enough about it.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "It\u2019s a bit old fashioned, but I always thought it was better, in politics, to tell people about the things you\u2019ve achieved not just the things you\u2019ve stopped. But people do need to know how coalition operates and what we do day in day out inside Government.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Ultimately it\u2019s up to the Prime Minister and me to make this work; where there are disagreements, we try and seek compromise, and by doing that we\u2019ve cracked problems that single party Governments have struggled with for decades: social care, pension reform, reducing reoffending, and so on.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "But sometimes compromise and agreement isn\u2019t possible and you just have to say \u201cno\u201d. Inheritance tax cuts for millionaires \u2013 no. Bringing back O\u2019 levels and a two-tier education system \u2013 no. Profit-making in schools \u2013 no. New childcare ratios \u2013 no. Firing workers at will, without any reasons given \u2013 no, absolutely not.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Regional pay penalising public sector workers in the north \u2013 no. Scrapping housing benefit for young people \u2013 no. No to ditching the Human Rights Act. No to weakening the protections in the Equalities Act. No to closing down the debate on Trident. Had they asked us, no to those \u2018go home\u2019 poster vans.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "No to the boundary changes if you cannot deliver your side of the bargain on House of Lords reform. And if there\u2019s one area where we\u2019ve had to put our foot down more than any other, have a guess. Yep, the environment.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "It\u2019s an endless battle; we\u2019ve had to fight tooth and nail; it was the same just this week with the decision to introduce a small levy to help Britain radically cut down on plastic bags.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "They wanted to scrap Natural England, hold back green energy. They even wanted geography teachers to stop teaching children about how we can tackle climate change. No, no and no \u2013 the Liberal Democrats will keep this Government green.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I don\u2019t pretend it\u2019s always easy to say no. Sometimes I\u2019ve had to wrestle with some genuinely difficult dilemmas \u2013 not just Tory party dogma.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "With the Snoopers\u2019 Charter, I took months listening to Home Office officials, the IT experts, the security services and the police because, as much as I am in Government to protect civil liberties, I also have to go to sleep at night knowing I did my bit to keep people safe.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Government ministers, loud voices in the Labour party, the securocrats and Whitehall were all adamant I should say yes. But, when push came to shove, it became clear that the surveillance powers being proposed were disproportionate: they would have massively undermined people\u2019s privacy, but the security gain was neither proven nor clear. It was right for the establishment, but wrong for the people. So I said no.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Obviously, we haven\u2019t been in coalition with Labour. I could give you a hypothetical list of bad ideas the Liberal Democrats would have to stop \u2013 but that would involve Labour producing some actual policies. Who here knows Labours plan for our schools? Or welfare? What would they do for the NHS? For industry? To cut crime?\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Well, Labour may not have an economic strategy, but fortunately we do. A bold plan for growth agreed by conference two days ago, built on sound public finances, with house-building, infrastructure and lending to business at its heart \u2013 Liberal Democrats turning Britain around.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "The truth is, Labour haven\u2019t set out any kind of vision for Britain because they didn\u2019t think they needed to. They have spent the last three years lazily assuming austerity would drive voters into their laps. For them, 2015 is all about the coalition parties losing rather than Labour having to actually try and win. And that tells you everything about why they act the way they do: their deliberate decision to put tactical victories ahead of long-term reform.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Remember the AV referendum? Not a happy memory for the Liberal Democrats, I accept. But do you remember that AV was in fact in Labour\u2019s manifesto? Yet it was Labour figures who were most staunch in the defence of the status quo \u2013 just to score points against us. Lords reform \u2013 something they historically believe in. Yet when they had the chance to vote for it they found excuses not to \u2013 just to score points against us.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Even when we hear good news about the economy, they\u2019re miserable \u2013 they\u2019d rather it be bad, just to score points against us. So I have a message for Labour today: you can\u2019t just duck responsibility for the past \u2013 refuse to spell out what you\u2019d do in the future \u2013 and expect people to give you a blank cheque.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "You can sit and wait for the British people to come back to you, but don\u2019t hold your breath. And if there is one area all of the parties need to put politics aside, it\u2019s Europe, and Britain\u2019s place in it. The Conservatives have this bizarre view that we can turn our back on Europe and still lead in the world.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "As if we\u2019ll be taken seriously by the Americans, the Chinese, the Indians, all the big superpowers when we\u2019re isolated and irrelevant in our own backyard. But the truth is we stand tall in Washington, Beijing, Delhi when we stand tall in Brussels, Paris and Berlin.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I know it because I worked there; I have seen with my own eyes what can be achieved for Britain by engaging with our neighbours and building the world\u2019s largest borderless single market upon which millions of jobs in our country now depend.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Of course the European Union needs reform \u2013 no one is saying it doesn\u2019t. But we cannot allow the contorted confusion of the right, the outright isolationism of UKIP, to jeopardise millions of British jobs and diminish Britain\u2019s standing in the world.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Liberal Democrats, it falls to us to stand up for the national interest: we will be the party of In. I am an internationalist \u2013 pure and simple; first by birth, then by marriage, but above all by conviction. We may be an island nation, but there\u2019s no such thing as an economic island in an age of globalisation.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And Britain is always at its strongest and proudest when we are open to the world \u2013 generous-spirited and warm-hearted, working with our neighbours and a leader on the world stage. That\u2019s the message I will take to New York next week, when I represent the UK at the United Nations General Assembly.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "There are some in the world who seek to present us as pulling up the drawbridge, following Parliament\u2019s decision not to consider a military intervention in Syria \u2013 but they will hear from me that they are wrong.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "My views on Syria are well known: I believe the use of chemical weapons \u2013 a war crime under international, humanitarian law \u2013 should be stopped wherever possible.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "But I understand why some people are wary of another entanglement in the Middle East \u2013 Iraq casts a long shadow \u2013 and we now have the opportunity to work with the UN, the Russians, the Americans, the French and others to put these heinous weapons beyond the reach of Assad\u2019s regime.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "What matters now is that we are clear that this nation is not heading into retreat. It would be a double tragedy if the legacy of Iraq was a Britain turned away from the world.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Others look to our values and traditions for inspiration. Democracy, peaceful protest, equality before the law. That, in itself, confers a leadership role on us. Not as some military superpower. Not out of some nostalgic impulse after the loss of empire.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "But because we believe in the virtues of law, peaceful dissent, political stability and human rights as enduring liberal values.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "These are values that my own family \u2013 affected by the wars and conflicts of the past like so many other families \u2013 never took for granted.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And Miriam and I try to teach our sons that they shouldn\u2019t take these values for granted either. After Spain moved to democracy in the 1970s, Miriam\u2019s father was the first democratically elected Mayor in a small agricultural town in the middle of the countryside.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",

        "A Scottish decision to remain within the UK family can and must give way to a new settlement for this nation.
