        "It\u2019s wonderful to be here in such august surrounds.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And it feels fitting that this house of historic international accord is the stage for another \u2013 and another of immense importance to us all.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "**Net-zero emissions**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "In November of last year, I was one of 50 Tory MPs who wrote to the Prime Minister and urged her to set a target of net-zero emissions by 2050.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "We felt then as we do now \u2013 that that we could decarbonise through science, not economic sacrifice\u2026\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u2026That our method would not be hair-shirted self-denial, but innovation and investment driven by the right incentives.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Our past should give us confidence.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "This country\u2019s ingenuity has kept the UK at the forefront of science and engineering for hundreds of years.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And, provided we keep our ambitions high, we will lead the world for hundreds more.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And the goal of net zero emissions will inspire us all to great heights of achievement.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Entrepreneurs will see opportunities in new industries, and create jobs all around the UK.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And the new technologies they create will clean the air we breathe, and cut the bills in our homes.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "In June this year, the government became the first major economy in the world to adopt the Net Zero 2050 target, which is fantastic news.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I was made a minister a month later and \u2013 while this is possibly slightly less momentous \u2013 I can assure you all I will do everything I can to make sure the government keeps its promise.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "**Why we\u2019re here today**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "The danger, as ever, with targets that lie 30 years in the future is that they are pushed to the bottom of the pile by the concerns of today.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "The trick, then, is to make constant, incremental progress \u2013 and celebrate it when it happens.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "To make sure that we keep chipping away at our long-term ambitions.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "That\u2019s why today is so important.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "**CIIF**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "The Charging Infrastructure Investment Fund is in many ways emblematic of our approach to Net Zero.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Our philosophy isn\u2019t that government can solve everything.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Of course, we have an important role to play \u2013 but we have to do it in partnership with the energy and expertise of the private sector.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Our approach is therefore to set up the right incentives and conditions, and then allow a powerful green market to flourish.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "In this case, we wanted to encourage more people to buy and use electric vehicles, or EVs, which are far less polluting than traditional cars.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "We set up grants for cars, taxis, vans and motorcycles.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "But we realised that people looking at buying EVs were wary of getting marooned, without any battery in their car left and miles away from home or the nearest charging point.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And handouts wouldn\u2019t cut it \u2013 we needed to unleash the power of the market.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "So, with Zouk Capital, we set up the Charging Infrastructure Investment Fund as a catalyst, with government money matching any private capital that comes in to maximise impact.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And we were delighted that Masdar chose to invest \u00a335 million in the fund \u2013 which the government topped up to \u00a370 million \u2013 for the installation of 3,000 rapid chargers across the country.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "This more than doubles the UK\u2019s number of rapid chargers, producing a dense network of stopping points where family cars can be charged in 20 minutes flat \u2013 the time it takes for a sandwich and a coffee on the way to the seaside.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And, further, it shows Masdar\u2019s continued participation in the UK\u2019s clean energy commitments.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Masdar has invested more than \u00a33 billion in the UK in the past ten years, predominantly in offshore wind.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "It\u2019s a pleasure to welcome Mohamed Al Ramahi here today for the signing ceremony and to talk more about how we can work together.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I hope you continue to discuss with my colleagues at the DIT to find strategic partnerships that work for both our countries.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Together, we\u2019re showing that change is possible. And providing leadership to governments and private companies around the world that by working together, we can effect real change.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Thank you.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals"
