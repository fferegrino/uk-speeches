        "Russia has a history of making false claims to provide cover for its own actions; the world can see through this attempt to use false allegations as a pretext for escalation. Russia needs to de-escalate, starting by ceasing its assault on Ukraine and withdrawing its forces.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I welcome the transparent approach Ukraine has taken by inviting the IAEA to put Russia\u2019s claims under independent scrutiny. Their findings show there is no evidence of undeclared nuclear activities by Ukraine.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "The UK remains committed to supporting Ukraine\u2019s efforts to defend its territory for as long as it takes.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals"
