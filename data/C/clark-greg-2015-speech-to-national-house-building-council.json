        "##  A turnaround decade for housing \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Thank you, it\u2019s an honour to speak to so many of you today \u2013 in a momentous week for housing, especially at an event hosted by the NHBC. Your timing couldn\u2019t be better after the [Spending Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spending-review-and-autumn-statement-2015-documents), so that I couldn\u2019t possibly come empty handed.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "The NHBC is a credit to the industry \u2013 an example of how standards can be raised and maintained independently of government.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Not only does the NHBC certify houses, it also helps insure them \u2013 providing warranties on around 80 per cent of all the new homes built in this country:\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "A model of taking direct responsibility that ought to be applied more widely.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "We can be proud that as other countries seek to establish similar organisations, it is to this country that they look for inspiration.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "The same cannot be said for every aspect of our country\u2019s record on housing.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "The first decade of the 21st century was not our finest hour:\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* housing bubble that burst with devastating consequences \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* industry in debt \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* sites mothballed \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* workers laid off \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* skills lost \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* the lowest level of peacetime house building since the 1920s \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* post-war low in house building by the private sector \u2013 and by councils \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* shrinkage in the stock of affordable housing \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* sustained fall in home ownership \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* chaos in the regulation of lending \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* and a planning system grinding to a halt \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "The roots of this failure run deep.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Through decades of a complacency about different components of the housing market.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Decades of political inertia.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And decades in which this country consistently failed to build enough homes.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "The Prime Minister has spoken of his determination to make this our turnaround decade.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "A decade in which we eliminate the budget deficit. But also the housing deficit.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "This may not be a familiar term, but if the level of house building falls below the level of household formation then a housing deficit is exactly what we have.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And, furthermore, a housing deficit that builds up into a housing debt \u2013 one that cashes out not just in house price inflation and falling ownership, but contributes to economic instability, social inequality and stunted opportunities.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "For the good of us all \u2013 and especially of the younger generation \u2013 we must, and will, put this right.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "##  Progress to date \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "So, five years into this turnaround decade, what progress have we made?\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Most importantly, there\u2019s been a significant recovery in the level of house building.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "This can be seen across of a variety of measures, there\u2019s no shortage of competition for housing statistics on any given week, but on this occasion let me refer to NHBC figures.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "In 2009, they registered 81,000 new homes; this year they expect to register 160,000.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "This is based on a pretty consistent 80 per cent share of the market and approximates to a doubling of building levels during this period.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And good progress continues to be made. The most recent year of figures shows a ten per cent increase in registrations.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "In fact, the net supply of housing has shown the biggest annual increase in almost three decades.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "This hasn\u2019t happened by accident. From the start, we did what was needed to get the house building industry back on its feet:\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* by stabilising the banking system \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* through financial guarantees for development; and in helping first time buyers \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* over 230,000 households have been helped into home ownership through government schemes \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* over 100,000 through the various strands of Help to Buy \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* the number of first time buyers is at a seven-year high \u2013 and now stands at double the low established in the previous decade \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* crucially, we\u2019ve increased the stock of affordable homes. Over 263,000 affordable homes have been provided in England since April 2010 \u2013 nearly one third of them in London. \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I might also add that twice as many council homes were built in these five years than during the previous 13 years.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "We reformed the planning system. I want to express my gratitude to many people in this room who supported us in this reform.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "They said it couldn\u2019t be done, but the [National Planning Policy Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2) is now four years old \u2013 and bearing fruit.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "In 2010, most local authorities didn\u2019t even have a Local Plan. Instead they had 1,300 pages of central planning guidance. And thousands more from the Regional Spatial Strategies.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "We removed this smothering blanket of verbiage and replaced it with the NPPF \u2013 a clear and accessible document of just 52 pages.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Now, the great majority of local authorities do have a Local Plan \u2013 and we will ensure that the rest are in place by 2017. Moreover, these are better Local Plans.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Those adopted since the NPPF set targets equivalent to 109 per cent of national household projections \u2013 versus 86 per cent for pre-NPPF plans.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Planning permissions in the year to the 31 March 2015 were up 13 per cent on the previous year and 64 per cent on the year to March 2010.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Overall, we now permit around a quarter of a million new homes every year; which, if built out, would be enough to close the housing deficit.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "##  The ongoing challenge \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "But there\u2019s more to do.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Of course, planning for all the homes we need isn\u2019t enough. We have to build them too.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "We must therefore go further and faster to ensure that this happens.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Since the election this year, my department has continued with the most effective measures of the previous parliament.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "We\u2019ve pressed ahead with the release of publicly-owned land for development.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And we\u2019ve introduced the [Housing and Planning Bill](http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2015-16/housingandplanning.html), which is in committee stage as we speak.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "This Bill includes:\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* provision for 200,000 Starter Homes by 2020 \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* an automatic register of brownfield land \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* and measures to speed up the CPO process \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* measures to support the extension of the Right to Buy from council tenants to housing association tenants \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Instead, we\u2019ve agreed a deal with the housing associations to get on with the job without delay. In return, the government will ensure that the proceeds of Right to Buy sales are used to build new affordable homes for rent and purchase.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "The housing associations have set an example here for the whole industry:\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* a willingness to move forward in order to build the homes we need; a readiness to be part of the progress we all hope to benefit from \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* to get to where we need to be, we must give something in return \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* and all parts of the industry do have something to give \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "We need to see a re-diversification of the sector. A big role not only for the housing associations, but also for councils, self builders, custom builders, small-and-medium-sized enterprises and overseas companies in that sector.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "This doesn\u2019t mean a smaller role for the biggest players in the industry.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Quite the opposite.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "To house a growing population we need more houses from everyone.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "This is not a zero-sum game.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "If we tried to play it that way, zero would be the sum of the progress made.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "##  The Spending Review \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Of course, a government shouldn\u2019t ask others to move out of their comfort zones if it isn\u2019t willing to do the same.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "For any Chancellor of the Exchequer, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, or Conservative government, intervening in the market and committing public money is not something done lightly.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Yet we are determined to invest in what matters most to Britain\u2019s future.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "As the Chancellor said yesterday in the Commons: \u201cin this Spending Review we choose housing.\u201d\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Specifically, we have secured over \u00a320 billion from the [Spending Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spending-review-and-autumn-statement-2015-documents) to support our wider ambitions to deliver one million new homes and to double the number of first time buyers.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Individual measures include:\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* extend the Help to Buy: equity loan scheme to 2021 \u2013 supporting the purchase of more homes \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* in London, a doubling of equity loans to 40%, providing the capital\u2019s aspiring home owners with a better chance to buy \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* and a \u00a31 billion Housing Delivery Fund to support small and custom builders \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* there will be \u00a38 billion for a total of over 400,000 affordable homes \u2013 the largest affordable housebuilding programme for many decades \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "* and we\u2019re making major investments in large-scale projects \u2013 including Ebbsfleet Garden City, Bicester, Barking Riverside and Northstowe \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "So, while the Chancellor has made clear his determination to close the budgetary deficit, he was equally clear that this will go hand in hand with action on the housing deficit.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Both are required to make this the turnaround decade.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "##  Both more and better \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Ladies and gentlemen, in the last five years both we and you have pulled house building up from the record lows of the previous decade.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "In the next five years we intend to push it up further, to levels not sustained for many decades.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "But this is not the limit of our ambitions.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "The challenges that I\u2019ve described in this speech were many decades in the making.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And so, as our focus moves from rescue to reform, we must address the deep structural weaknesses in the way that this country plans and builds for the future.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "This work is already underway through reforms like the NPPF, and the work must go on.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Though the investment announced in the spending review is vital and necessary \u2013 we must also move to a future in which we which we can provide new homes without constant intervention from the centre.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "In which demand for housing can be met as readily as demand for other goods in our society.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "This goes beyond numbers alone.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "As well as building more homes, we must build better homes.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Indeed, better streets and neighbourhoods too.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I am proud that we have made \u2013 and will continue to make \u2013 such progress together on quantity.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "But let\u2019s not waste the chance to also make progress together on quality.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "We must redouble our efforts.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "To achieve our objectives we don\u2019t just need the commitment of the government and the industry, but of the nation as a whole.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Ultimately that means convincing people that development is a force for making places better not worse.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Therefore, the task before us is build both more and better.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And, together, we will.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Thank you.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals"
