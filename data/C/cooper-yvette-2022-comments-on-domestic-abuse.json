        "We\u2019ve been putting huge pressure on the Government to lift the time limit so I\u2019m glad they have now accepted our proposal to stop victims of domestic abuse being timed out of justice.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "We will keep up the pressure for more action. This is one of many measures Labour is pushing for to tackle violence against women and girls. Over the last five years prosecutions for rape and domestic abuse have plummeted. Too many perpetrators are being let off, too many victims are being let down and the Conservative Government isn\u2019t doing enough to turn that around.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Labour has a serious and workable plan to tackle the epidemic of Violence Against Women and Girls. Thank you to everyone who backed the campaign for this change and we will keep pushing for further action.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
