        "Today\u2019s UN General Assembly vote is a powerful demonstration of the international community\u2019s widespread condemnation of Russia\u2019s outrageous, illegal attempts to annex the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "This is an important show of international unity against an aggressor that seeks to destabilise the international norms that protect us all. In the face of President Putin\u2019s unprovoked aggression, 143 nations across the globe have come together in defence of the UN Charter and in solidarity with Ukraine.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "The vote is indisputable evidence of what we have known for some time \u2013 Putin stands alone on the international stage and his actions are driving his country further into self-inflicted isolation.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals"
