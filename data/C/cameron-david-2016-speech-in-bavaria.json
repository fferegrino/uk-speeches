        "Well thank you very much Gerda **[Hasselfeldt]** for the warm welcome that you have given me and let me send my thanks as well to the Minister-President and also to Angela Merkel who I had an excellent meeting with last night.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "It\u2019s a great pleasure to be back here in Bavaria and looking around, I can understand why Bavarians feel they are particularly blessed with this beautiful landscape.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "It has been a pleasure to come, the relationship between Britain and Germany is so strong and so important. We look at the world in so many of the same ways. We know you have to earn money before you can spend it, we know the importance of backing enterprise and business to create jobs, we know the importance of the Atlantic Alliance for our security. We know how important it is, as we enter 2016, that we confront Islamist extremism and terrorism and that we do so together.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So our relationship is very deep and very strong as members of the European Union, as members of NATO and also the relationship between our parties as parties of the centre-right, has also been very strong and will continue to be strong in the future.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "I really enjoyed the discussions here today and the presentation I was able to make. My aim is very clear \u2013 I would like to secure the future of Britain in a reformed European Union but this reform is vital.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Britain does have real issues with the way that the European Union works today and my negotiation is about dealing with each of those issues. Making sure that we\u2019re in Europe for cooperation and to work together, that we\u2019re not part of an ever-deepening political union, making sure that Europe is adding to the competitiveness of countries like Britain, and indeed Germany, rather than holding back our competitiveness. Making sure there are fair rules for both countries that are inside the eurozone and countries like Britain that won\u2019t join the eurozone but want the eurozone to be a success. Who want to make sure that outside the eurozone there are no disadvantages, that we\u2019re not called upon to support the eurozone financially.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "These are important issues, as is the issue of migration and movement across Europe. Britain supports the concept of free movement. Many British citizens can go and live and work elsewhere in Europe but we want to make sure that the welfare systems \u2013 and particularly our welfare system \u2013 is not an unnatural draw to Britain because we do feel the pressure of excessive migration that we\u2019ve had in recent years.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We believe that all these issues can be dealt with. The discussions are going well. They\u2019re hard, they\u2019re tough, these are difficult issues but I\u2019m confident that with goodwill \u2013 and there is goodwill on all sides \u2013 we can bring these negotiations to a conclusion and then hold the referendum that we promised in our election manifesto and we\u2019ve now legislated for in Parliament.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "In the end, the choice will be for the British people but I want to make sure they have the very best choice of staying in a reformed European Union, giving Britain the best of both worlds.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "A part of Europe for trade and cooperation, working together on the security challenges that we face, helping to keep our people safe, particularly in the difficult and dangerous world that we face. But not joining the Euro, the currency that many have in the European Union, not being part of the Schengen no borders agreement \u2013 we\u2019ll keep our own borders in Britain and strengthen those borders. And making sure we address each and every 1 of the 4 issues that I\u2019ve raised.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "I\u2019m even more confident after the excellent discussions I\u2019ve had here in Bavaria with colleagues in the CSU that these things are possible, not just good for Britain but good for Europe. Not simply because other European countries will benefit by Britain continuing to be a member of Europe but I think its important that this organisation shows it has the flexibility of a network and can address concerns of individual members, rather than the rigidity of a bloc.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "I\u2019m confident we can reach good conclusions but it\u2019ll take a lot of hard work. I\u2019ve been very heartened by the goodwill I\u2019ve felt from the fellow sister party members in the CSU here in Bavaria today and let me once again thank you for the warmth of your welcome. I remember coming 7 years ago and its been even more pleasurable to come back again and have these discussions with you.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Thank you.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant"
