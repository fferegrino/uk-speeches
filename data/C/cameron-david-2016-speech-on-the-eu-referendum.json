        "Thank you very much, thank you. Well, thank you for that and a very good morning. Great to be back at B&Q, and thank you all for coming today.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "This country has worked incredibly hard to recover from the recession of 7 years ago. Businesses have invested, people have taken risks, companies have come to this country, but above all the people of Britain have worked incredibly hard to get over that recession. And the 2 of us have worked together to try and put the right framework in place. Now we haven\u2019t got every decision right, but the deficit is right down, the economy is growing, we\u2019re creating jobs. Britain is making things again, and making its way in the world again. 2.4 million more people in work. We\u2019ve got low inflation. We\u2019ve almost got a million more businesses than when we first got our jobs in 2010. But yes, we still have a long way to go; yes, there is more to do. But I think there can be no doubt: Britain is on the right track.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Now I don\u2019t want us to do anything that sets us on the wrong track. After all, that\u2019s really the job description of a Prime Minister: to safeguard the nation\u2019s security. Exactly a month from today, we\u2019re going to make a decision that will determine our future security. I believe that leaving the EU would put our security at huge risk, that it would be the wrong track for Britain.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Why? Because, as we know, and as even Leave campaigners now freely admit, we\u2019d lose full access to the European single market. We\u2019d be abandoning the largest marketplace in the world, half a billion people. It\u2019s a market which Britain helped to create, and which is the source of so much of our economic security. Inside that market, our businesses can trade freely and investors can invest here easily. That keeps our economy growing. That keeps our jobs safe, keeps the pounds strong, keeps our families secure. It means that a business from here in Eastleigh can get their goods to market anywhere in the EU, and get better access to all the places with which the EU has trade deals. So no Spanish importers saying to our manufacturers, \u2018That doesn\u2019t fit our regulations.\u2019 No French minister saying to our farmers, \u2018We don\u2019t buy British beef.\u2019 No tariffs, no barriers, just Britain doing what we need to do, getting out there and trading with our neighbours.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Now leaving this arrangement, our special status in the EU, is a leap in the dark, because no one has said what we\u2019d have in its place. Now we already heard last month, from the Treasury, that the long-term impact of leaving would be a cost to every household equivalent to \u00a34,300. Today we publish analysis of what would happen in the short term, in the immediate months and years after a British exit. As businesses freeze up, confidence drains, uncertainty clouds over, and an economic shock shakes our nation.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Now, the Chancellor will go into the details shortly, but I just want to focus on the impact it would have on your life, the job you do, the home you live in. Your weekly shop, your monthly bills. These things are all at risk. As the Bank of England has said, as the IMF has underlined, and as now the Treasury has confirmed, the shock to our economy after leaving Europe would tip the country into recession. This could be, for the first time in history, a recession brought on ourselves. As I stand here in B&Q, it would be a DIY recession. And it really matters to everyone.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Someone actually asked, in this debate, the other day, you know, \u201cThat\u2019s the economic case. What about the moral case?\u201d But don\u2019t they realise that the economic case is the moral case? The moral case for keeping parents in work, firms in business, the pound in health, Britain in credit. The moral case for providing economic opportunity rather than unemployment for the next generation. Where is the morality in putting any of that at risk for some unknown end? This government was elected just over a year ago to deliver security at every stage of life, to build a greater Britain out of a great recession, and, after all the pain, all the sacrifice of the British people, why would we want to put it at risk again? It would be like surviving a fall and then running straight back to the cliff edge. It is the self destruct option.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So much of this debate is muddied and overshadowed by speculation about who says what about whom, and who\u2019s in this camp or that camp. We need to strip away the drama, and focus on real life, because this isn\u2019t about political parties or personalities or Prime Ministers. It\u2019s about you, about your money and your life. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher, the risks couldn\u2019t be greater, and, in my view, the choice couldn\u2019t be clearer. Leave Europe and put at risk what we\u2019ve achieved; stay in Europe, and stay on the right track.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And now it\u2019s time to hear that analysis of the short-term impact. So over to you, Chancellor.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "[The Chancellor\u2019s [speech is available here.](https://www.ukpol.co.uk/2016/05/23/george-osborne-2016-speech-on-hm-treasury-analysis-of-leaving-the-eu-2/)]\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant"
