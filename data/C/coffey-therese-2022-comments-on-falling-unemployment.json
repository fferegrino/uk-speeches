        "Unemployment is at its lowest since the 1970s with full time workers across the UK \u00a36000 better off than if they were on benefits. And there are still vacancies to fill. That\u2019s why our jobcentres are helping employers short circuit the recruitment process so they can get talent in fast. So, if you\u2019re hiring, make the most of the help on offer from us.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
