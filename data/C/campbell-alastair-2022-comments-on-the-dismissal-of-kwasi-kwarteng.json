        "I know we are talking small sums compared to the many billions spaffed on extra borrowing costs, not to mention the Covid billions wasted and lost to incompetence and corruption. But another consequence of the constant ministerial merry go round under Johnson and Truss is the continuing cost to the public purse after these useless charlatans lose their jobs. Johnson gets a huge PM allowance for life. They get pay-offs/pensions that rise because they have been \u201cministers.\u201d The system has to be changed. Incompetence cannot keep being rewarded\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals"
