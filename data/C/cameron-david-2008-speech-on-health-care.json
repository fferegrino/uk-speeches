        "\u201cA few weeks ago, I said the aim of a Conservative Government is to be as radical in social reform as Margaret Thatcher was in economic reform. That\u2019s why, in office, our reform plans will focus on three particular things.",
        "\u201cThe first is radical school reform \u2013 so our kids get the best education and learn the skills that will help them compete in the globalised economy. The second is welfare reform, so people move from long-term poverty to long-term employment. And the third is to strengthen families and make Britain the most family-friendly place in the world.",
        "\u201cBut I also said, in that same speech, that the NHS must come first. There\u2019s a simple reason for this. It\u2019s because health \u2013 be it that of your own or your loved ones \u2013 is everyone\u2019s priority and so it should be for politics too. And as we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the NHS this summer, let me make it one hundred percent clear:",
        "\u201cThe fact we have a health service that takes care of everyone- whatever their needs, backgrounds and circumstances \u2013 is one of the greatest gifts we enjoy as British citizens and the Conservative Party will never \u2013 ever \u2013 take that for granted. We back the NHS. We will build it. And we will improve it for everyone.",
        "**GREEN PAPER**",
        "\u201cAnd that\u2019s what this Green Paper we\u2019re launching today is all about. It sets out our ambition for the NHS \u2013 to improve our health outcomes, like cancer survival rates, so they are among the best in Europe. And it sets out how we will do that \u2013 by scrapping Labour\u2019s bureaucratic, top-down process targets and replacing them with outcome measures , so that the professions can focus on the result itself, not how it is achieved. The ambition \u2013 the means. Let me briefly take each in turn.",
        "**IMPROVING OUTCOMES**",
        "\u201cFirst, the ambition \u2013 to improve health outcomes so they are among the best in Europe. Now this may seem obvious \u2013 but it actually signals a major shift in the focus of the NHS. To understand that, we need to go back eight years.",
        "\u201cBack then, Tony Blair sat on Sir David Frost\u2019s sofa and committed the Labour government to matching European levels of health spending. Today, that pledge has been delivered. But despite all this extra money \u2013 all that extra spending \u2013 we still have some of the worst health outcomes in the whole of Europe. Right now, England\u2019s near the bottom of the table when it comes to five-year cancer survival rates \u2013 far below countries like Sweden and Germany, and on a par with Slovenia and Poland. We have one of the worst records of diabetic control \u2013 especially among children. And it\u2019s awful that you\u2019re more likely to die from a stroke in England than you are in any other country in Western Europe.",
        "\u201cSo we\u2019ve got a situation where we pump the same money into our health system as other countries, but on the thing that actually matters \u2013 a patient\u2019s health and the results of their actual treatment \u2013 we\u2019re doing worse. Seriously, if the NHS isn\u2019t about improving the health of people \u2013 making them live longer, happier and more fulfilling lives \u2013 then what is it about?",
        "\u201cThis is so typical of Labour. So obsessed with the process that they\u2019ve lost sight of the bigger, and more important, picture \u2013 making people better. We\u2019ve made clear our commitment to increase spending on the NHS, year on year, so it gets the investment it needs.",
        "\u201cBut what this Green Paper sets out is how we\u2019ll make sure that money delivers \u2013 by making our health outcomes among the best in Europe. And be in no doubt about what this will mean. If we improve the NHS so it meets the international average, we could save an extra 38,000 lives a year. If we improve the NHS so our results are comparable to the best countries in the world, we could save over 100,000 lives a year. That\u2019s thousands of more people surviving cancer, surviving strokes and surviving lung disease. There really is no greater ambition for the NHS as it approaches its sixtieth birthday.",
        "**HOW WE\u2019LL DO IT**",
        "\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking \u2013 great ambition, but how are you going to deliver it? One thing I\u2019m sure of: we won\u2019t get there through yet another massive structural reorganisation. The past decade has witnessed a series of restless changes which, to the NHS itself, have felt like a series of frontal assaults \u2013 the latest of which is a national network of polyclinics imposed on local communities \u2013 and GPs \u2013 that don\u2019t want them. Instead, we\u2019ll offer steady, purposeful change with a clear direction.",
        "\u201cSo we will build on and improve the NHS we inherit. Foundation hospitals won\u2019t go, they\u2019ll stay \u2013 and we\u2019ll improve them. Commissioning by GPs is right \u2013 and we\u2019ll make it really mean something. Not Labour\u2019s phoney \u2013 and imaginary \u2013 budget-holding, but actually giving GPs real control over their budgets so they can re-invest savings and negotiate contracts with service providers to get best deal for their patients.",
        "\u201cPatient choice is essential \u2013 and we\u2019ll make it actually work. Referral management centres were brought in to manage referrals between primary and secondary care. But too often they\u2019ve overturned a patient\u2019s choice of hospital and ordered them to get treatment elsewhere. Patient choice must really mean just that \u2013 so we\u2019ll let patients choose any provider that meets NHS standards at delivers at NHS costs. Progressively, patiently, carefully, we will usher in a new era of quality and care.",
        "**NEW ACCOUNTABILITY**",
        "\u201cBut what this Green Paper is all about is how we can improve our health outcomes by ushering in a new era of patient-doctor accountability through an information revolution. If the last ten years has taught us anything, it\u2019s that Labour has tested to destruction the idea that the NHS can be improved by more bureaucracy, more central control and more initiatives from the Department of Health.",
        "\u201cThis approach is embodied no better than in the endless top-down process targets they impose on doctors and hospitals. Superficially, some of these targets may look sensible. After all, no one wants to wait a long time to be seen in A&E. But because they push healthcare professionals to make decisions purely to \u2018tick boxes\u2019 rather than because they\u2019re beneficial to the health of their patient, too often the result is worse patient care and a worse health outcome. So we get the perverse situation where patients are kept in ambulances or in trolley waiting areas just so hospitals can say they\u2019ve meet the centrally-directed four-hour A&E waiting time limit.",
        "\u201cThis is crazy. Labour\u2019s targets are all about chasing good headlines \u2013 and nothing to do with the clinical needs and the health of patients. So yes, to make sure our health outcomes are among the best in Europe, a Conservative Government will scrap all centrally-imposed process targets. But don\u2019t for one minute believe the Labour lie that we\u2019re giving up on quality \u2013 that we\u2019re going to leave a vacuum of accountability.",
        "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a new approach. In fact, it\u2019s an approach so obvious \u2013 and so simple \u2013 you\u2019ll be astonished it doesn\u2019t already happen. In place of Labour\u2019s self-defeating top-down targets, we will harness the power of information and publish the details of healthcare outcomes. So we\u2019ll measure cancer survival rates, instead of recording the number of radiotherapy courses delivered per month in a particular oncology unit. We\u2019ll measure how well patients are after treatment, instead of timing how long someone\u2019s in an A&E bed. And we\u2019ll measure how many people lead active lives whilst suffering from chronic lung disease, instead of recording how many records GPs have updated into information systems.",
        "\u201cThis is about concentrating not the \u2018how\u2019, but the \u2018what\u2019 about concentrating not on what politicians care about, but on those things that people really care about. How long will my Dad survive if he gets cancer? What are my chances of a good life if I have a stroke? What are my chances of surviving from heart disease? This is the kind of information people want and need. And this is the kind of information that will replace Labour\u2019s bureaucratic, top-down and centralised idea of accountability \u2013 between minister and doctor with a post-bureaucratic, bottom-up and de-centralised one \u2013 between patient and doctor.",
        "\u201cJust think about the change this will bring. No more five-minute chats in your GP\u2019s surgery picking a hospital based on its waiting times and availability. But the power \u2013 the ability \u2013 to really compare and contrast different care providers on the things that really matter to you and are easily understandable \u2013 survival rates, after care service, patient satisfaction.",
        "\u201cAnd with that patient choice and patient accountability, the rest will follow. For a start, we\u2019ll start to get real value for money in the NHS. That\u2019s because those who commission care \u2013 like primary care trusts and GPs \u2013 will be better able to decide how to get the best for their patients from the money available. And instead of sinking money into meeting top-down, politically motivated targets, care providers can actually focus on innovative approaches to getting the right outcomes for their patients and giving real value for money to the taxpayer. But more importantly than anything else, the quality of service will go up and we will achieve the sort of health outcomes enjoyed in the rest of Europe.",
        "\u201cIt goes without saying that by making outcome information readily available, we will introduce an element of healthy competition between different care providers. They\u2019ll be able to see what works and what doesn\u2019t \u2013 what different practices are doing to achieve result and how they can learn from them. This isn\u2019t about creating a cut-throat business environment. It\u2019s about understanding that everyone who works in the NHS is rightly proud of where they work and will do everything and anything to provide the best possible care.",
        "**CONCLUSION**",
        "\u201cI\u2019m now going to hand over to Andrew Lansley who will explain in greater detail the changes we are proposing. But let me end by saying this.",
        "\u201cFew things matter more to our country than the NHS. I know the fear that all families feel when they think they won\u2019t get the care they need. And I know the relief they feel when a kind, competent nurse or doctor is there for them. And in this, the NHS\u2019s sixtieth year, I\u2019m proud that people now look at the Conservative Party as the party of the NHS.",
        "\u201cBut I don\u2019t just want us to be the party of the NHS \u2013 I want us to be the party of a better NHS. And that means being clear about our ambition \u2013 to save thousands of more lives a year. And it means being clear about how we\u2019ll get there. No more pointless re-organisations \u2013 just building and improving. No more top-down process targets \u2013 but an information revolution to measure outcomes. No more talking about patient power \u2013 but actually giving it to them, through greater accountability. That\u2019s the way we can create a health service that is truly the envy of the world.\u201d"
