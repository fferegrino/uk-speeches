        "I\u2019m standing here today because I want to lead the Conservative Party and I want to lead it to victory at the next General Election. Now there are some who say I\u2019m a bit too young. Some who say I\u2019ve just been in Parliament for five years, maybe I don\u2019t have the experience to do the job. And in some ways they\u2019re right. I am only 38 years old, I have only been in Parliament for five years. But I believe that if you\u2019ve got the right ideas in your head and the right passion in your heart, and if you know what this Party needs to do change, then you should go for it.",
        "And that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing it.",
        "There are people who say that the Labour Party under Gordon Brown will move to the left, that the economy\u2019s going to hit the rocks, that all we\u2019ve got to do is wait and just give it one more heave. I think that is rubbish. And I think it would be a pathetic way for a great Party like this to behave.",
        "There are some people who say that we\u2019ve just got to attack the Government with a bit more vigour, we\u2019ve just got to pull them apart a little bit more.",
        "I say that\u2019s wrong. We\u2019ve already called Tony Blair a liar.",
        "The problem at the last election was not that people trusted the Labour Party \u2013 they didn\u2019t. They got the lowest level of support for a Government in our political lifetime. The problem was that people don\u2019t yet trust the Conservative Party, and it\u2019s we who have got to change.",
        "There are some people who say it\u2019s just about coming up with more radical policies and putting them forward with more passion and with more vigour. Of course we\u2019ve got to have the right policies, but that alone won\u2019t do it.",
        "At the last election we had lots of good policies. Yesterday, the Government introduced our food policy for schools. Three days ago, they introduced our policy to scrap the revaluation of the council tax. The very day after the election, the Prime Minister stood on the steps of Downing Street, and spoke about respect and virtually introduced our school discipline policy.",
        "It\u2019s not policies alone that are going to do it.",
        "It\u2019s not even, dare I say it, having a young, energetic and vigorous party leader, although come to think of it that wouldn\u2019t be such a bad idea.",
        "It\u2019s not just organisation, it\u2019s not just presentation, it is something much more fundamental.",
        "We have to explain to people what it means to be a Conservative in 2005. We\u2019ve had, frankly, a leadership election that I think has sent half the country to sleep \u2013 including some of the people who\u2019ve been taking part in it. We\u2019ve made interesting speeches, we\u2019ve come up with interesting policy ideas, we\u2019ve trotted out that mantra of things that we believe in.",
        "But we\u2019ve got to say what those principles mean in 2005 and how they\u2019ll make a difference to this country in the future.",
        "We talk about personal responsibility. We talk about support for the family. For lower taxes. For limited government. For national sovereignty. But what we have to do is make the change in the culture and identity of the Conservative Party and say what those things mean today, and that\u2019s what I want to do.",
        "Personal responsibility. I believe passionately that people should be free to run their own lives and to choose. But personal responsibility must not mean selfish individualism. There is a we in politics as well as a me.",
        "And when we look at an increasingly atomised society, in which people don\u2019t talk to each other, in our inner cities we have different races living separate lives, we need a shared responsibility \u2013 a sense that we\u2019re all in this together. That not just individuals and families have responsibilities, but also government and business.",
        "And that\u2019s why one of the things I\u2019ve put forward is the idea of a School Leaver Programme. To say to people, to say to voluntary bodies and to business and to the Armed Forces \u2013 think of a great four month programme that you can put young people through, so that they can do something together, whatever their class, their background, their colour or whatever part of the country they come from.",
        "Lower Taxes. I believe passionately that we should leave people with more of their own money to spend as they choose. But lower taxes cannot mean coming up to an election time with a small bunch of personal tax cuts that just undermine our credibility and make people think that we\u2019re out there to bribe them to vote for us.",
        "Our belief in lower taxes has got to be about making this economy competitive and dynamic and the best place in the world to have jobs and invest and have businesses. We\u2019ve got to have a sense in the Conservative Party, that we want to share \u2013 an important word \u2013 share the proceeds of growth between better public services on the one hand and lower taxes on the other hand.",
        "Limited Government. I desperately want the State to be our servant and not our master. But rolling back the state must never mean that the weak and defenceless are left behind. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve spoken about a whole new compact with the voluntary sector and social enterprises, to deal with the most difficult problems in our inner cities \u2013 with drug dependency, family breakdown, persistent unemployment, poor public space.",
        "In the 1980\u2019s we said to businesses \u2013 go to that part of the country where the economy is broken, pay no tax, pay no rates and bring wealth to those areas.",
        "Today we ought to be saying the same to social entrepreneurs \u2013 go to that part of the country where society is broken and solve those deep-seated problems that government has consistently failed to solve.",
        "National Sovereignty. I do believe that this country does best when we govern ourselves and we\u2019re proud of our institutions. But national sovereignty must never mean isolation or xenophobia. This is an incredible country with its best days ahead of it.",
        "We should be proud of the fact that we are a leading member of the European Union, of NATO, that we\u2019re on the UN Security Council, that we\u2019re a leading member of the Commonwealth.",
        "And what we must do is show how we can engage ethically and enthusiastically with the rest of the world.",
        "And when the Conservative Party talks about international affairs, it can\u2019t just be Gibraltar and Zimbabwe \u2013 we\u2019ve got to show as much passion about Darfur and the millions of people living on less that a dollar a day in sub-Saharan Africa who are getting poorer while we are getting richer.",
        "If we have the courage to explain what each and every one of the Conservative principles that make us Conservatives mean today, then, we can win.",
        "But it is a change of culture and identity. There is no Clause 4, there is no magic wand, there is no one thing that we can do to show that this party thinks Britain\u2019s best days ahead.",
        "It is a change right across the board.",
        "This party has got to look and feel and talk and sound like a completely different organisation.",
        "It\u2019s got to be positive. I want no more by-election campaigns or General Election campaigns when our message is overwhelmingly negative and when we just attack our components.",
        "I want us to be optimistic, talking to peoples\u2019 hopes and not their fears.",
        "And I want us to be a consistent Conservative Party. There are times in this quite new politics we have when Tony Blair sits in the middle of the British political spectrum, when he says or even does Conservative things.",
        "Tuition fees. Foundation hospitals. City academies.",
        "When he does these things, I want a Conservative Party that says yes, that is a good idea, let me show you how to make it even better. Not one that seeks a way of opposing him and just looks opportunistic and insincere.",
        "And we\u2019ve got to change every part of our party, including how we select candidates. Having more women standing for Parliament is not political correctness, it is political effectiveness. If the conversation we have within our own party doesn\u2019t reflect the conversation we\u2019re having with the general public, we won\u2019t win, and we won\u2019t deserve to win.",
        "These are the changes we have to make, and I\u2019m passionate about making them. Because I am fed up of sitting on well-leathered green benches in the House of Commons, and I don\u2019t want to wait another four years of opposition while we make the same mistakes again. I say why put off what has to be done.",
        "I\u2019m fed up with people coming to my surgeries \u2013 young mums, who say, I can\u2019t handle this complicated tax credits and benefits system and I can\u2019t get the help I need, what I want is to be floated free, to keep more of my own money as I choose to.",
        "I\u2019m fed up of listening to businessmen, who find the combination of tax and regulation mean it\u2019s not worth investing and growing and giving people jobs.",
        "I don\u2019t want to have to go on hearing from pensioners who can\u2019t pay the council tax and when they see there\u2019s so much waste in government, they know what their hard-earned money is going towards.",
        "This is a practical party \u2013 Conservatives are not ideologues but we are idealists.",
        "We do have a dream. A dream of a country where the brightest kid from the poorest household can go to the best university. A dream where it\u2019s the easiest country to set up a business, to employ people, to make money, to invest and to put it back. A dream where we have a stable society in which families who do the right thing, who actually try and work hard and do the right thing for their children are rewarded rather than punished.",
        "But all the dreams in the world won\u2019t come true unless we have the courage to change.",
        "That\u2019s what this leadership election is about. Everyone is now saying we need a modern, compassionate Conservatism. I absolutely believe that is the case, and the choice for the Party has got to be, who do you think really believes it, who will really stick to it? When the going gets tough and the press attacks you after a couple of years and say this isn\u2019t distinctive enough, it isn\u2019t attacking enough, who will dig into their core and say, well that\u2019s what I believe.",
        "I\u2019m not changing just to win, I\u2019m changing because I think it\u2019s right for the country, it\u2019s right for our times, it\u2019s right for a whole generation of people who feel so switched off politics.",
        "So that is the choice we\u2019ve got to make. We can win, we can make this country better, but we can only win if we change. That\u2019s the question I\u2019m asking the Conservative Party. Don\u2019t put it off for four years, go for someone who believes it to the core of their being.",
        "Change to win \u2013 and we will win."
