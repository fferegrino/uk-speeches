        "Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you. Great \u2013 great to be here. No long introduction from me because I really want to spend this time answering your questions. Let me just make 2 points; about the budget and the thinking behind it.",
        "The first is this: you can tell a lot about a society by how much it enables people to live in dignity and security in their old age. Now, I am not claiming that we have solved all the problems of helping pensioners in our country, but this government, while making difficult long term decisions about our economy and our future, has tried to help pensioners live out their lives in dignity and security.",
        "We protected the basic state pension with the triple lock, so it always goes up by earnings, prices, or 2.5%: whichever is the highest. That\u2019s had a real impact over the last few years. We protected those pensioner benefits, a promise that we\u2019ve kept in terms of the Winter Fuel Allowance, the free TV licences, the bus passes and suchlike. That is important.",
        "Then you\u2019ve got these moves in the budget which will help pensioners to use their savings better. And so you\u2019ve got the abolition of the 10p rate on savings income up to \u00a35,000; you\u2019ve got the pensioner bonds. The pensioner bonds are very important because a lot of pensioners say to me, \u201cLook, I\u2019ve worked hard, I\u2019ve put some money aside, but because interest rates are so low I don\u2019t really get any income from my savings.\u201d These pensioner bonds will help pensioners to do that; there\u2019s \u00a310 billion worth of them available, but there\u2019s a limit of how much any one person can take. And so it\u2019s a good way of helping pensioners have that dignity and security.",
        "So that\u2019s the first thing I wanted to say. The second thing I wanted to say is that all of this links to the long term economic plan that we have for our country. We\u2019re involved in a giant turnaround exercise: to take an economy that was truly troubled after the 2008 Great Recession and give it a chance of success in the modern age.",
        "Now this plan, at its heart, is about creating jobs, and we\u2019ve got more people in work. It\u2019s about cutting people\u2019s taxes, and we\u2019ve now lifted to \u00a310,000 the amount of money you can earn before you start paying income tax. It\u2019s about making sure that we build the schools and provide the skills that are going to be essential for future generations. It\u2019s about controlling immigration and controlling welfare, so that people who work hard and do the right thing get rewarded. And it\u2019s about building the infrastructure that this country needs.",
        "So, it\u2019s a plan and you can see every aspect of this plan and we\u2019re going to report in on this plan over and over again. By the end of it I expect you\u2019ll be bored to death of hearing about this plan but the point I want to make about this plan is actually not the facts and figures, but the values behind it. Because in the end, that\u2019s what matters most of all: why are we doing this? Who are we doing it for? And what will the country feel like when this plan is successful?",
        "And the values, I would say, at the heart of it are, first of all, that if you work hard the system should be on your side and help you, rather than punish you. That\u2019s why being able to earn \u00a310,000 before paying tax is so important. That\u2019s why allowing pensioners to keep more of their savings, get a decent income in retirement and not to have to take out an annuity, so they can spend their money as they choose. That\u2019s why that value \u2013 about trusting people, helping people and recognising the worth of working hard and saving \u2013 is so important.",
        "But perhaps the most important value of all \u2013 particularly at a time when people see economies struggling, and, worldwide, the difficult positions people are in \u2013 most important value of all is stability and security. Giving people a sense that we want to help you have that security and stability in your life, whether that\u2019s about helping people to get a job, whether it\u2019s about helping people to start a business or whether it\u2019s giving people that dignity and security in old age. Those are the values that lie behind this plan and this budget was very much in line with this plan and I\u2019m really pleased about the steps we\u2019ve been able to take to help pensioners have that dignity and security, to reward saving and to say, \u201cIt\u2019s your money to spend as you choose.\u201d",
        "But I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be many other things that pensioners want, that future pensioners are worrying about, that you want to ask me about today. So please don\u2019t hold back; any question you like and I will do my best to answer it.",
        "**Question**",
        "Thank you. Prime Minister, I\u2019m not going to talk about pensions; I\u2019m talking about inheritance tax. And I recall your promise when you came into power \u2013 or just before you came into power \u2013 about inheritance tax was going to have a quantum leap \u2013 I think it was about \u00a31 million \u2013 and now we see that it\u2019s not. A lot of us save not just for ourselves but for our children, our grandchildren, and in this particular area we see house prices rising year on year, in fact, month on month, and yet we\u2019re not being able to pass on a lot of that inheritance because most of our equity is tied up in a house. So that 1 issue, I think, gives us a lot of concern. Are you able to address that?",
        "**Prime Minister**",
        "If we go back \u2013 I\u2019m not going to give you a history lesson, sir, I wouldn\u2019t dare \u2013 but if we go back to 2007: in those days you could only \u2013 the threshold for inheritance tax was \u00a3325,000. And if you remember, George Osborne \u2013 then shadow Chancellor \u2013 made this speech and made this promise that we wanted to radically change that and lift it to \u00a31 million. That was our aim. Straight away after that, Gordon Brown \u2013 realising what a brilliant pledge it was by George Osborne \u2013 then changed the rules so that you could pass between husband and wife, and also between civil partners. So the effective threshold for inheritance tax went from \u00a3325,000 to about \u00a3700,000.",
        "But would I like to go further in future? Yes I would. I believe in people being able to pass money down through the generations and pass things onto their children. I think you build a stronger society like that. And I think, of course we should \u2013 you know, you have to have caps and limits and we have to think about those, but generally speaking we should be encouraging people to pass things on to their children. And 1 of the reasons why George Osborne made that pledge was this point about property, was that when the limit was \u00a3300,000 or so, quite a lot of, you know, hard working families who\u2019d worked hard, who\u2019d saved, who\u2019d put that money into their house, were being caught by inheritance tax. And inheritance tax should only really be paid for by \u2013 only really be paid by the rich; it shouldn\u2019t be paid for by people who\u2019ve worked hard, who\u2019ve saved and who\u2019ve bought a family house in Peacehaven for example.",
        "So the ambition is still there; I would like to go further. It\u2019s better than it was [Party political content] but it\u2019s something we\u2019ll have to address in our manifesto.",
        "**Question**",
        "I wonder if I could ask you a question about infrastructure? We\u2019re in this great county of Sussex \u2013 West Sussex, Brighton and Hove, East Sussex \u2013 1.5 million people, but a bare 5 miles of motorway, Prime Minister, in the whole county. Is it possible you could ask the transport secretary to look at that motorway deficit, particularly in respect of lack of East/West motorway and the possibility of expansion of Gatwick Airport?",
        "**Prime Minister**",
        "Well, first of all, on the Gatwick Airport, I can\u2019t really say anything about that because we\u2019ve got the Davies Review that is looking at our airport capacity, and he\u2019s said there are really 3 options. He said we need more \u2013 we need more capacity. Not immediately, it\u2019s not a panic, but he says we do need to add another runway if we want to try and keep our hub status as a country. And he\u2019s got 3 suggestions: he says that there is the Heathrow suggestion, the Gatwick suggestion, or possibly \u2013 the east of London option.",
        "So all of those 3 are being looked at. I think he\u2019s doing a good job. 1 of the things he\u2019s done is stop people panicking about this issue. He says that it has to be addressed but we don\u2019t have to do it tomorrow, but we do need to make a decision in good time and we will in the summer of next year.",
        "In terms of roads, actually I would say this government has stepped forward with quite a lot of investment into road and rail schemes. I know sometimes in places like Sussex people say, \u201cWell all the money\u2019s going to go on HS2.\u201d Does anyone think that; all the money\u2019s going to be wasted on HS2? Here\u2019s the fact of the day for you: in the next Parliament, we\u2019re going to spend 3 times more on other road and rail schemes as we will on HS2. I think HS2\u2019s really important, it\u2019s actually going to link up our country, it\u2019s going to help drive economic development through the Midlands and the North and bring the country together \u2013 but we\u2019ll be spending lots of money on other things. So there will be money available for pinch-point schemes in places like Sussex, for road and rail improvements. In terms of motorway deficits I\u2019m very happy to look at what you say. There have been some specific road upgrades in Sussex in the last few years, but we we\u2019re happy to look at more.",
        "**Question**",
        "I\u2019m 70 years old. I have a pension pot which I haven\u2019t touched yet, but I\u2019ve been looking into an annuity. With the budget changes, what benefits do you see for my pot?",
        "**Prime Minister**",
        "Right. Okay. One of the most important things in the budget is the money for face-to-face financial advice, because I think this is a very complicated area \u2013 pensions \u2013 and people really need to have good advice before they take a decision. What we\u2019ve decided to do, sir, and this may help you \u2013 I don\u2019t know your own circumstances \u2013 we\u2019ve got the bigger decision that happens in April 2015, which ends the need to have to buy an annuity if you\u2019re in a defined contribution scheme, and most people are now in defined contribution schemes. But even before that, we\u2019ve taken a set of measures that help people to draw down income from their pensions by changing the rules around that they help people take a bigger cash lump sum, including in small pension pots, and they change some of the tax circumstances around those things. So my advice would be to talk to your own financial advisor, see your own circumstances, and whether these changes can help you.",
        "Behind them all is a very simple piece of thinking, which is that you\u2019ve worked hard, you\u2019ve saved during your life. That money in your pension pot is basically your money and you should have greater freedom to spend that as you choose.",
        "Now of course you then get the argument \u2013 and we\u2019ve heard a bit of this over the last few days \u2013 \u201cWell, if you allow people to spend their own money, they\u2019ll blow it all on a cruise; they\u2019ll spend all the money, and then where will we be?\u201d Well first of all I\u2019d say it\u2019s deeply condescending to say to people who\u2019ve worked hard, who\u2019ve saved all their lives, who\u2019ve been thinking about the future \u2013to say, \u201cWell you can\u2019t trust them to spend their own money because they\u2019re irresponsible people.\u201d They\u2019re not irresponsible people; they\u2019re responsible people. That\u2019s why they saved in the first place.",
        "But if you want to get technical there\u2019s another reason for feeling confident about this change which is that we\u2019re changing the basic state pension system in this country. Right now, as you know, you get your basic state pension and then there\u2019s a minimum income guarantee and a top-up through the pension credit which takes you up above \u00a3140 if you\u2019re a single person. And what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re replacing that basic state pension and the pension credit top-up \u2013 replacing it with what\u2019s called a single tier pension, so when people retire, they will retire on a basic state pension of above \u00a3140.",
        "Now why that matters so much is because it is lifting people out of the means test, it\u2019s lifting people out of that pension credit top up, so even if they do go and spend lots of money on certain things they\u2019re not going to be reliant on a means tested system. They\u2019ll be reliant on the basic state pension which will have lifted them above the means test system. So I would argue this is the right thing to do; giving people more opportunity to spend their own money as they choose, giving people more freedom, but it\u2019s also the right time to do it, because we\u2019ve changed the system fundamentally so that it wouldn\u2019t have the bad consequences were people to go and blow all their money. But I don\u2019t believe they will, because I don\u2019t believe people are fundamentally irresponsible; I think people are fundamentally responsible. I believe in trusting the people, a slogan my party came up with at the turn of the 20th century, and I think we should stick to it now.",
        "**Question**",
        "All I want to do is say thank you. I\u2019ve been holding on to my trivial pension since you got elected, and I\u2019ve been asking you to change it to what it is now. If I\u2019d have cashed my pension in when I should have done, I\u2019d have had 25% and \u00a314,000 a year pension. Now, I can draw the whole lot out and thank you very much indeed.",
        "**Prime Minister**",
        "Thank you. I mean, there\u2019s \u2013 what\u2019s interesting about this argument is that we were \u2013 when I was a back bench MP \u2013 I was elected in 2001 \u2013 there was a private member\u2019s bill then called the Curry Bill, and it was to try and abolish the need to take out an annuity. And we went along and we voted for this bill Friday after Friday, and tried to get it through, but even that bill wasn\u2019t as good as what we\u2019re doing now because there was no single tier pension proposal then so even an abolition of annuities proposal still had lots of small print about how much income you had to have before you could guarantee that you wouldn\u2019t need an annuity. And so it\u2019s this single tier pension move that\u2019s made it possible to do what we\u2019ve done, and I\u2019m really glad that it\u2019s going to benefit people like you.",
        "You still pay tax on it, of course. You draw it down, but you pay it at your marginal rate and this is a really good argument, because then you can draw down money year after year in a way that makes sure that you pay tax on it, but you pay at your marginal rate, rather than pushing yourself up into a higher rate.",
        "**Question**",
        "The budget seemed almost perfect. What has George got left for next year; he needs to pull a few rabbits out of hats. Has he got anything left?",
        "**Prime Minister**",
        "Well, I mean, budgets are \u2013 it\u2019s a very dramatic event, the budget, isn\u2019t it? I think we all \u2013 it\u2019s sort of a national event. I\u2019m not sure other countries get quite as excited about their budgets as we do. But you know, a budget is only as good as the underlying economy that it is commenting on, and I think while, you know, I\u2019m very keen today to talk about these important steps for pensioners and trusting people to spend their own money as they choose and rewarding savings, actually, in a way the real news in the budget was that the economy is improving. We still haven\u2019t reached the peak that we were at before the crash, as it were, but we\u2019re working our way back and the really encouraging thing is we\u2019ve seen 1.3 million more of our fellow countrymen and women in work \u2013 that\u2019s good news \u2013 we\u2019ve got 400,000 more business operating in Britain, we\u2019re exporting more to fast growing markets on the other side of the world.",
        "So the economy\u2019s on the mend but there\u2019s a lot more work to do. What George and what I and others will be thinking about for next year\u2019s budget will depend on how well the economy is doing and whether we can continue to make some progress in helping people to keep more of their money to spend as they choose. But that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about \u2013 budgets are great events, great buzzy events \u2013 but in the end what really matters is the long-term economic plan, turning the economy around and making sure we have an economy that is delivering a recovery for all. Because the truth is there\u2019s still lots of people in our country, who \u2013 they may have found work, they may have found that job, but earnings are still going up quite gradually, prices in the shops are still quite high, people are still feeling that it\u2019s a very tough set of circumstances, recovering from this very difficult, long and great recession. But we are getting there, and if we stick at the plan, we can make sure more people feel it.",
        "**Question**",
        "There are many people who\u2019ve worked hard all their lives, done the right thing, as you rightly said, and when they get to pension age they obviously are, so-called, wealthy. Are you able to give any commitment on withdrawing Winter Fuel Payments and bus passes for so-called wealthy pensioners.",
        "**Prime Minister**",
        "Well I made a very clear pledge at a Saga gathering, and I made it again at the election, that we should keep the pensioner benefits. Obviously all pledges are about the Parliament that you\u2019re going into and we make new pledges in our manifesto for the next Parliament. But we said very clearly we would uprate the basic state pension, keep the Winter Fuel Allowance, free TV license, the bus pass, the cold-weather payments, and we\u2019ve done all of those things. We\u2019ve kept our promises in all of those areas.",
        "We\u2019ll set out our policy for the next Parliament at the next election. I don\u2019t want to pre-judge that. The only thing I would say to people who think you save lots of money by not giving these benefits to top-rate tax payers is that you save a tiny amount of money and you always introduce another complexity into the system. But we made our promise to this Parliament, we\u2019ve kept our promise in this Parliament. I\u2019m very proud of that, because I don\u2019t think older people in Britain should be asked to suffer for the difficult decisions that we have to make. Making promises and keeping promises is a very important part of politics so woe betide the politician that makes one of these big promises and then says \u201cOh, sorry, I didn\u2019t really mean it.\u201d",
        "**Question**",
        "We\u2019ve just very recently done a scrutiny in Brighton & Hove on the effects of alcohol in the city, because we do have quite a problem with binge drinking etc, and 1 of the things that came out of that was the amount of excessive drinking that is done in people\u2019s homes by older people. It\u2019s something that really came to the fore, and I just wondered if you could tell us what the thinking was in reducing the tax on beer by a penny a pint, and were health issues taken into account when that was considered?",
        "**Prime Minister**",
        "Absolutely they were. I think the decision behind the beer duty is really much more about our pubs.",
        "We do have a problem in terms of binge drinking, and sometimes that\u2019s spilling over into violence and bad behaviour and anti-social behaviour on our streets. We do have a problem with that, and we have to tackle it in lots of different ways. We need to address, 1 of the biggest causes of the problems, which is excessively cheap drink provided by supermarkets deep discounting and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve passed this rule to say you can\u2019t sell for less than duty plus VAT, and that will have an impact. I think there are all sorts of things we need to do in terms of policing and in terms of public order which we are doing, and the evidence is that the situation is getting better rather than worse.",
        "But I don\u2019t think we should take steps that would disadvantage the responsible drinker and the responsible pub,. Pubs have had a pretty tough time in recent years \u2013 a combination of the smoking ban, very cheap drink in supermarkets, some of the other regulations and all the rest of it. And I\u2019m a great supporter of Britain\u2019s pubs, I think they provide a sort of social glue to help bring communities together \u2013 the focus for the village, the focus for your part of the town \u2013 and so trying to help pubs by cutting beer duty, which we\u2019ve done in both of the last 2 budgets is the right thing to do.",
        "I did look at the idea of minimum unit pricing for alcohol, which is an idea that\u2019s got a lot of merit, because you\u2019re basically saying a unit of alcohol, however it\u2019s consumed, should never cost less than, say, 40p, and they\u2019re trying this in Scotland. And that wouldn\u2019t actually put up the price of a pint in a pub, nor would it put up the price of a bottle of wine in a supermarket. But I think 2 things: 1 is, we should wait and see how it goes in Scotland, and see whether it works in Scotland, and the second thing is, at a time when families are having to take difficult decisions about budgets and everything else, I think it\u2019s just a change too many. So I let\u2019s let the duty plus VAT thing settle down, let\u2019s see what happens in Scotland, but yes, public health concerns about alcohol, public order concerns about alcohol, very important part of what the government\u2019s doing. But don\u2019t let\u2019s clobber pubs as we try and get this right.",
        "**Question**",
        "I can see that ending the annuities is very popular with many people, myself included, and I can see that spending money on cruises would be a very good idea. But you were talking about dignity in old age, and you\u2019ve only got to visit hospitals where perhaps 60% of the beds are taken by elderly people who are called patients, to see that many people don\u2019t have dignity. And it feels like politicians have been asleep by the fireside for the past 30 years. Isn\u2019t the truth that a lot of the pension pot that I and others will take \u2013 isn\u2019t that going to end up in the pockets of private nursing home owners?",
        "**Prime Minister**",
        "Well look, first of all, I would repeat what I said about giving people the choice. You don\u2019t have to take out an annuity; you don\u2019t have not to take out annuity: you\u2019ve got the choice now; you can decide whether that\u2019s right for you. If what you\u2019re saying is, \u201cDoes dignity and security in old age have a lot to do with much more than money?\u201d I absolutely agree with you. We won\u2019t have true dignity and security in old age until we make sure our NHS really does everything it can to look after older people better. Now, there are some great examples of care and frankly there are some less good examples of care and the Health Secretary and the Care Quality Commission are now really shining a light on standards and quality of care.",
        "I think we need to do a lot more on dementia. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve set a dementia challenge for the country. We\u2019re going to double the amount of research that\u2019s going in. We\u2019re encouraging communities and people to become more dementia friendly, to learn about the nature of these diseases. We\u2019ve got to stop this rather condescending and wrong attitude that dementia is just part of ageing. It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a disease and we ought to be trying to tackle it like we\u2019re trying to tackle cancer or heart disease.",
        "But the point about care homes is also important, because I know there is a concern that, of course, if you take your money out of your pension pot and have it as your own money, then it counts as your money when you are assessed for care needs. That is true; that is the case. But, again, you have the choice: you can leave money in your pension pot or take it out. And also, we are putting in place a cap on the amount of money that someone can be charged for their care needs. And I think this was a very important step we took in this Parliament, a step we took very much as a coalition; we talked about it, it was a very big change. And I think there was a great unfairness that if you were hit, say, with dementia, sometimes at a relatively young age, you could be facing hundreds of thousands of pounds in nursing home charges eating up every last penny of savings that you had in your house, in your savings account or elsewhere. Putting a cap on the maximum amount that you can lose is a fair and a good step to take.",
        "We haven\u2019t solved the problem of dignity and security in old age but protecting spending on the NHS, protecting the pension, protecting the pension benefits and now allowing pensioners more freedom to spend their own money as they choose are all good steps forward.",
        "**Question**",
        "Now, talking of health, pensioners have nothing unless they have health to enjoy their life. The Royal Sussex County Hospital, our local large hospital, in fact has had planning permission \u2013 you know where I\u2019m going now, I think \u2013 has had planning permission for a massive extension which will be beneficial, should the need arise, to everybody here in this room. Could you assist to get the capital released to enable the build?",
        "**Prime Minister**",
        "You\u2019ve given me a very clear message. I can\u2019t say anything about it now. It\u2019s something that the Treasury and the Department of Health are looking at. I know how important it is. You know, this is a vibrant city and people want to see really good health services in their community. So message received and understood.",
        "**Question**",
        "What can you do or what would you like to do where people own their own homes and when they go into a nursing home they\u2019re made to sell their homes to pay for their care, whereas somebody that has not got their own home, they get exactly the same as I or any of my friends would get that have to pay for it and it costs them nothing? After all, national health is from the cradle to the grave and not everybody needs a nursing home.",
        "**Prime Minister**",
        "That\u2019s absolutely right. It\u2019s what I was discussing with the gentleman here. I mean, I think there has been this unfairness in the system in that you can have 2 people living next door to each other; 1 person\u2019s worked hard, saved, bought their own home, the person next door has not done any of those things. The person next door without the savings, without owning the home, gets the whole of their care paid for while the person who\u2019s saved gets charged. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve brought in the Dilnot cap, so that there\u2019s a cap of \u00a375,000 on how much you can draw down in terms of paying for that care. This should mean \u2013 because this is early days in terms of this policy coming in \u2013 that no one has to sell their home to pay for their care.",
        "What we\u2019re hoping it\u2019s going to do once we\u2019ve brought the cap in and said there\u2019s a maximum that you can have to spend on your own care, is drive the creation of a really exciting insurance market so that people can insure even against losing the \u00a375,000.",
        "Now, this is all coming in in the next few years, it hasn\u2019t started yet, so this insurance market hasn\u2019t taken off in the way that I\u2019d like yet, but it will. It\u2019s an expensive step we\u2019ve taken, because obviously, tragically, lots of people are having to sell their homes to pay for care now, but the ideal is a situation where you\u2019ve got a cap, you\u2019ve got an insurance market, no one has to sell their home to pay for care. And even if people choose to, they should be able to delay that into the future.",
        "So that\u2019s the aim, and I think again it links to this thing about dignity and security in old age, which is absolutely what drives me and drives this government in terms of coming up with the right policies.",
        "Thank you very much indeed."
