        "It\u2019s a huge honour to be standing before you as leader of the Conservative Party.",
        "And first of all I want to thank you for the support you\u2019ve given me in the past ten months.",
        "It\u2019s been a time of great change.",
        "I\u2019m already on my second leader of the Liberal Democrats.",
        "Before long I\u2019ll be on to my second Labour Prime Minister.",
        "Soon I\u2019ll be the longest-serving leader of a major British political party.",
        "I wanted this job for a very simple reason.",
        "I love this country.",
        "I have great ambitions for our future.",
        "And I want the Party I love\u2026",
        "\u2026to serve the country I love\u2026",
        "\u2026in helping Britain be the best that it can.",
        "We need to change in order to have that chance.",
        "You cannot shape the future if you\u2019re stuck in the past.",
        "You knew that.",
        "And that\u2019s why you voted for change.",
        "I believe we can all be proud of what we\u2019ve achieved these past ten months.",
        "People looking at us with new interest.",
        "25,000 new members.",
        "And in our first electoral test, in the local elections, we won forty per cent of the vote.",
        "Let\u2019s hear it for our fantastic local councillors who worked so hard and won so well.",
        "Tony Blair says it\u2019s all style and no substance.",
        "In fact he wrote me a letter about it.",
        "Dear Kettle\u2026",
        "You\u2019re black.",
        "Signed, Pot.",
        "What a nerve that man has got.",
        "In the whole of the last year, there is only one substantial thing that the Labour Party has achieved for our country.",
        "Their education reforms.",
        "Right now, across the country, trust schools are being prepared with greater freedoms to teach children the way teachers and parents want.",
        "The only reason \u2013 the only reason \u2013 that\u2019s happening is because the Conservative Party did the right thing and took the legislation through the House of Commons.",
        "I\u2019m proud of that \u2013 proud of us, for putting the future of our children before party politics.",
        "Another sign of our changing fortunes is the impressive array of speakers who have come to join us at our conference this year.",
        "**SENATOR McCAIN**",
        "And I\u2019d like to pay a special tribute to one in particular.",
        "He\u2019s a man who knows about leadership.",
        "He\u2019s endured hardship that\u2019s unimaginable to many of us here.",
        "And he\u2019s fought battles for principles that we all admire.",
        "Who knows what the future may hold?",
        "But John, I for one would be proud to see you \u2013 a great American and a great friend to Britain \u2013 as leader of the free world.",
        "**COLLEAGUES**",
        "I\u2019d also like to pay tribute to my colleagues who have spoken already today.",
        "A year ago, David Davis and I were rivals.",
        "Today we\u2019re partners.",
        "He has given me the most fantastic support over these past ten months.",
        "Ideas, energy, advice.",
        "He has not only helped bring this Party together\u2026",
        "\u2026he has helped take our Party in the right direction, and I want to thank him for all he\u2019s done.",
        "And I\u2019m proud to work with another man who is a brave politician, a wise counsellor and a great Conservative.",
        "A man who would be a Foreign Secretary that this country could be truly proud of: William Hague.",
        "Then there\u2019s Francis.",
        "I know Francis likes to pretend that everything is doom and gloom.",
        "He\u2019s always talking about the mountain we have to climb.",
        "He\u2019s so gloomy, he makes Gordon Brown look like a ray of sunshine.",
        "But Francis, you\u2019re doing a great job.",
        "**LABOUR SPLITS AND BACKSTABBING**",
        "Of course Francis has long told us to avoid the point-scoring and name-calling that can give politics such a bad name.",
        "He\u2019s right.",
        "But we didn\u2019t bargain on the Labour Party.",
        "First Gordon said he could never trust Tony again, then Tony called Gordon a blackmailer.",
        "Charles said Gordon was stupid, then John popped up and said no, Tony was stupid.",
        "Charles called Gordon a deluded control freak.",
        "And a member of the Cabinet said \u201cit would be an absolute effing disaster\u201d if Gordon got to No.10.",
        "That was just the husbands.",
        "When I look at these Labour ministers I ask myself how much time they\u2019re worrying about their own jobs\u2026",
        "\u2026and how much time they\u2019re worrying about NHS, about crime, about our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
        "You only have to ask the question to know what the answer is.",
        "And there are months more of it still to come.",
        "Months of infighting, instability, indecision, jockeying for position\u2026",
        "They said it would be a \u201cstable and orderly transition.\u201d",
        "Yeah, right.",
        "Like they said \u201c24 hours to save the NHS\u201d, \u201ceducation education education.\u201d",
        "These are the things they should be fighting for, but they\u2019re too busy fighting each other.",
        "**OUR RESPONSIBILITY**",
        "So we have a great responsibility.",
        "To set out a clear, united and credible alternative.",
        "With some elections, you just know the result before a single vote has been cast.",
        "We were never going to win in 1997.",
        "People wanted change.",
        "I remember it well.",
        "I fought Stafford.",
        "And Stafford fought back.",
        "Labour were never going to win in 1983 when they offered Michael Foot as Prime Minister.",
        "Other elections are wide open.",
        "And the next election will be one of those.",
        "But we will not win, nor deserve to win, without a clear purpose and a proper plan.",
        "We must learn from Labour\u2019s big mistake.",
        "When Tony Blair won his first election, he had only one clear purpose: to win a second term.",
        "Even now he says that the only legacy \u2013 the only legacy \u2013 that really matters to him is Labour winning a fourth term.",
        "Back in 1997, he had no proper plan.",
        "No real understanding of how to make change happen.",
        "He had good intentions.",
        "But he hadn\u2019t worked out how to deliver them.",
        "So New Labour went round and round in circles.",
        "They abolished grant maintained schools \u2013 and now they\u2019re trying to recreate them.",
        "They reversed our NHS reforms \u2013 and now they\u2019re trying to bring them back.",
        "Road building \u2013 cancelled, then reinstated.",
        "They wasted time, wasted money, wasted the country\u2019s goodwill.",
        "Only now, after nine years, does Tony Blair seem clear about his purpose.",
        "Well I\u2019m sorry Mr Blair.",
        "That\u2019s nine years too late.",
        "**THIS WEEK**",
        "We won\u2019t make the same mistake.",
        "On Wednesday, the last day of our conference, I want to talk in detail about the important issues we face as a nation \u2013 and what our response will be.",
        "But today, on this first day of our conference, I\u2019d like to set the scene for our discussions this week.",
        "I want to explain how we will arrive at the next election knowing exactly what we want to do, and how we\u2019re going to do it.",
        "My argument is based on a simple analogy.",
        "Getting ready for the responsibility of government is like building a house together.",
        "Think of it in three stages.",
        "First you prepare the ground.",
        "Then you lay the foundations.",
        "And then, finally, brick by brick, you build your house.",
        "**PREPARING THE GROUND**",
        "These last ten months, we have been preparing the ground.",
        "Our Party\u2019s history tells us the ground on which political success is built.",
        "It is the centre ground.",
        "Not the bog of political compromise.",
        "Not the ideological wilderness, out on the fringes of debate.",
        "But the solid ground where people are.",
        "The centre ground is where you find the concerns, the hopes and the dreams of most people and families in this country.",
        "In 1979, they wanted a government to tame the unions, rescue our economy and restore Britain\u2019s pride.",
        "Margaret Thatcher offered precisely that alternative.",
        "And this Party can forever take pride in her magnificent achievements.",
        "Today, people want different things.",
        "The priorities are different.",
        "Safer streets.",
        "Schools that teach.",
        "A better quality of life.",
        "Better treatment for carers.",
        "That\u2019s what people are talking about today.",
        "But for too long, we were having a different conversation.",
        "Instead of talking about the things that most people care about, we talked about what we cared about most.",
        "While parents worried about childcare, getting the kids to school, balancing work and family life \u2013 we were banging on about Europe.",
        "As they worried about standards in thousands of secondary schools, we obsessed about a handful more grammar schools.",
        "As rising expectations demanded a better NHS for everyone, we put our faith in opt-outs for a few.",
        "While people wanted, more than anything, stability and low mortgage rates, the first thing we talked about was tax cuts.",
        "For years, this country wanted \u2013 desperately needed \u2013 a sensible centre-right party to sort things out in a sensible way.",
        "Well, that\u2019s what we are today.",
        "In these past ten months we have moved back to the ground on which this Party\u2019s success has always been built.",
        "The centre ground of British politics.",
        "And that is where we will stay.",
        "**LAYING THE FOUNDATIONS \u2013 SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY**",
        "But preparing the ground is just the first stage.",
        "Now we must show what we will build there.",
        "A strong government needs strong foundations.",
        "And I want us to lay those foundations this week.",
        "That\u2019s not about individual policies.",
        "It is about a vision of the Britain we want to see.",
        "A Britain where we do not just ask what government can do.",
        "We ask what people can do, what society can do.",
        "A Britain where we stop thinking you can pass laws to make people good.",
        "And start realising that we are all in this together.",
        "Social responsibility \u2013 that is the essence of liberal Conservatism.",
        "That is the idea I want us to explain this week.",
        "That is what we stand for.",
        "That is what we\u2019re fighting for.",
        "That is the Britain we want to build.",
        "Take fighting crime.",
        "It is not just a state responsibility.",
        "It is a social responsibility.",
        "Let\u2019s not pretend that all we need is tough talk and tough laws to bring safety to our streets.",
        "Of course the state must play its part.",
        "That\u2019s why we\u2019re developing a programme of radical police reform.",
        "That\u2019s why we want to build more prisons and reform the ones we\u2019ve got, so they help reduce re-offending instead of encouraging it.",
        "And that\u2019s why we\u2019ll invest in drug rehabilitation, so we help addicts get clean and stay clean, instead of living a life of crime to feed their habit.",
        "But that is not the end of the story.",
        "It is just the start.",
        "We need parents to bring up their children with the right values.",
        "We need schools to be places of discipline and order.",
        "We need to stand up for civilised values in public places.",
        "We need to design crime out of the housing estates of the future.",
        "We\u2019ve got to stop selling alcohol to children.",
        "We need the music industry to understand that profiting from violent and homophobic words and images is morally wrong and socially unacceptable.",
        "But more than this, we need people, families, communities, businesses to step up to the plate and understand that it\u2019s not just about stopping the bad things\u2026",
        "\u2026it\u2019s about actively doing the good things.",
        "Not waiting for the state to do it all, but taking responsibility, making a difference, saying loudly and proudly: this is my country, this is my community: I will play my part.",
        "That is social responsibility.",
        "That is our idea.",
        "So I want us to be the champions of a new spirit of social responsibility in this land.",
        "A new spirit of social responsibility that will succeed for Britain where Labour\u2019s outdated state responsibility has failed.",
        "**LABOUR\u2019S APPROACH**",
        "Think of any issue \u2013 not just crime \u2013 and then think of Labour\u2019s response.",
        "This Government\u2019s way of doing things \u2013 the old way of doing things \u2013 is so familiar, and so depressing.",
        "Ministers hold a summit.",
        "They announce an eye-catching initiative.",
        "A five-year plan.",
        "Gordon Brown generously finds the money for it.",
        "The money gets a headline, but no-one knows what to do with it.",
        "So they create a unit in the Cabinet Office.",
        "A task force is set up.",
        "Regional co-ordinators are appointed.",
        "Gordon Brown sets them targets \u2013 after all, it is his money.",
        "Pilot schemes are launched.",
        "The pilot schemes are rolled out across the country.",
        "They are evaluated.",
        "Then revised, re-organised and re-launched.",
        "And then finally, once the reality dawns that the only people to benefit are the lawyers, accountants and consultants of Labour\u2019s quango army\u2026",
        "\u2026with a pathetic whimper \u2013 but no hint of an apology \u2013 the whole thing is just abandoned.",
        "We\u2019ve seen too much of this in the past nine years.",
        "Headline after headline but absolutely no follow-through.",
        "It is a story of ignorance, incompetence, arrogance.",
        "A story of wasted billions \u2013 and disappointed millions.",
        "Somewhere out there, there is a place where Blair and Brown will never go.",
        "It\u2019s dark.",
        "It\u2019s depressing.",
        "It\u2019s haunted by the failures of nine years of centralisation, gimmick and spin.",
        "It is the graveyard of initiatives, where you\u2019ll find the e-University that died a death,",
        "the drugs czar that came and went\u2026",
        "\u2026the Individual Learning Accounts that collapsed in fraud and waste, the tax credits that were paid and reclaimed\u2026",
        "\u2026the Connexions service that flopped, the Strategic Health Authorities that were dropped\u2026",
        "\u2026the marching of yobs to the hole in the wall; the night courts that never happened at all.",
        "And still they keep coming, those hubristic monuments to big government, the living dead that walk the well-trodden path from Downing Street and the Treasury to New Labour\u2019s graveyard of initiatives.",
        "The NHS computer: delayed, disorganised, a \u00a320 billion shambles.",
        "Forced police mergers: the direct opposite of the community policing we need.",
        "And then the perfect example.",
        "ID cards.",
        "When a half-way competent government would be protecting our security by controlling our borders\u2026",
        "\u2026these Labour ministers are pressing ahead with their vast white elephant, their plastic poll tax, twenty Millennium Domes rolled into one giant catastrophe in the making.",
        "They\u2019ve given up trying to find a good reason for it.",
        "Last week Tony Blair said that ID cards would help control immigration, when new immigrants won\u2019t even have them.",
        "Does he even know what\u2019s going on in his Government?",
        "ID cards are wrong, they\u2019re a waste of money, and we will abolish them.",
        "These last nine years have been the story of a Government which instinctively believes, whatever it says, that everything is the state\u2019s responsibility.",
        "We believe in social responsibility.",
        "Because there is such a thing as society, it\u2019s just not the same thing as the state.",
        "**THE BRITAIN WE WANT TO SEE**",
        "So let us define this week the kind of Britain we want to see.",
        "And let us show how our idea \u2013 social responsibility\u2026",
        "\u2026not Labour\u2019s idea \u2013 state responsibility\u2026",
        "\u2026is the right response to the challenges Britain faces.",
        "**GLOBALISATION, WELL-BEING, THE ENVIRONMENT**",
        "We know that in the age of globalisation, in the face of fast-moving economic change, people want their government to provide security.",
        "We know that the end of the traditional 9 to 5 job can make life tough for families, and people look to their government for answers.",
        "And we know that in the race against time to tackle climate change and protect the environment, people expect their government to show leadership.",
        "On all these challenges, Labour\u2019s first response is to regulate business, hoping to offer protection.",
        "It may sound attractive.",
        "But there are unintended consequences.",
        "Well-intentioned regulation can make us less secure in the age of globalisation.",
        "Less able to provide the jobs, wealth and opportunity on which well-being depends.",
        "It can undermine the competitiveness of our companies, so it\u2019s harder for them to invest in the new, green technologies of the future.",
        "So our response, based on our philosophy of social responsibility, is to say to business:",
        "Yes you should look after your workers, yes you should look after your community, yes you should look after our environment.",
        "And we must stand up to big business when it\u2019s in the interests of Britain and the wider world.",
        "So next week our MEPs will vote to strengthen proposals to make companies replace dangerous chemicals with safe ones.",
        "But where Labour are casual about increasing regulation, we will be careful.",
        "We will ask:",
        "Are we making it easier to start a business?",
        "Easier to employ someone?",
        "Is the overall burden of regulation going down?",
        "Will the regulation that\u2019s being put forward lead to real changes in behaviour, or just time-wasting and box-ticking?",
        "If only we had a government that was asking these questions today.",
        "We want companies to create their own solutions to social and environmental challenges, because those are the solutions most likely to last.",
        "So in a Conservative Britain, corporate responsibility will provide the best long-term answer to economic insecurity, well-being in the workplace, and environmental care.",
        "It is the same approach when you look at the other great challenges we face.",
        "**PUBLIC SERVICES**",
        "We know that in an age of amazing technological advance, instant information exchange, and empowered consumers who don\u2019t have the deference of previous generations\u2026",
        "\u2026people expect more from our health service and our schools.",
        "And government has to respond to that.",
        "Labour\u2019s response is the culture of targets, directives and central control, aimed at raising standards in our public services.",
        "They mean well.",
        "But the unintended consequence is to make these services less responsive to the people who use them, dashing expectations not meeting them.",
        "So our response, based on our philosophy of social responsibility, is to say to our nurses, doctors, teachers:",
        "Yes you should meet higher standards, yes you should give your patients and your pupils more.",
        "But we\u2019re not going to tell you how to do it.",
        "You are professionals.",
        "We trust in your vocation",
        "So in a Conservative Britain, professional responsibility will provide the answer to rising expectations in the NHS and schools.",
        "**POVERTY AND REGENERATION**",
        "And just as people will no longer accept second best in public services, we know that in their communities they are fed up with squalor and poverty and crime\u2026",
        "\u2026and they look to their leaders to sort things out.",
        "Labour\u2019s response has been a massive expansion of central government into local communities.",
        "The centralised Neighbourhood Renewal Unit, the insensitive Pathfinder programme, prescriptive top-down schemes for regeneration.",
        "You can see why Labour have done it.",
        "But the unintended consequence is to stifle the very spirit of community self-improvement that they are responding to.",
        "Our response, based on our philosophy of social responsibility, is to trust local leaders, not undermine them.",
        "So we will hand power and control to local councils and local people who have the solutions to poverty, to crime, to urban decay in their hands.",
        "We trust in your knowledge and commitment.",
        "So in a Conservative Britain, civic responsibility will provide the answer to improving the quality of life in the communities left behind.",
        "**CHILDREN**",
        "And then perhaps the greatest challenge of all.",
        "The challenge of bringing up children in a world that often seems fraught with risk and danger.",
        "There is nothing that matters more to me than the safety and happiness of my family.",
