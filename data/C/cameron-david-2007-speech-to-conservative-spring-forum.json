        "This has been a great Spring Forum.",
        "We\u2019ve seen the progress we\u2019re making in our Policy Review.",
        "We\u2019ve shown our commitment to community campaigning and making a real difference locally, in every part of the country.",
        "We\u2019ve focused on our new priorities \u2013 public services, the environment, improving everyone\u2019s quality of life.",
        "And today I want to explain why I\u2019m optimistic \u2013 for our Party and our country.",
        "I want to set out what we\u2019re doing and where we\u2019re going.",
        "Why we\u2019re making progress.",
        "The new priorities we\u2019re focusing on.",
        "And how we\u2019re going to win the big argument in British politics today.",
        "**PARTY CHANGE**",
        "This Party is changing \u2013 and we\u2019re doing it together.",
        "People said we\u2019d never get more women candidates without compulsion.",
        "But you selected them.",
        "Over a third of our candidates are women \u2013 up from just nine per cent in Parliament today.",
        "And you\u2019ve selected six black and minority ethnic candidates in winnable seats \u2013 three times more than we have in Parliament today and six more than the Liberal Democrats who don\u2019t have any.",
        "But let\u2019s be honest.",
        "It\u2019s not nearly enough.",
        "I\u2019ll tell you why this is so important.",
        "We believe in opportunity and aspiration, and in bringing our country together.",
        "That means making sure that in every part of our national life \u2013 the army, the media, business, the City, Parliament\u2026",
        "\u2026there are role models that young people in every community can look to and say yes, they made it so I can make it, I can go for it, I can do it too.",
        "We\u2019re changing our approach to politics too.",
        "People are fed up with politicians who disagree just for the sake of it.",
        "They want us to work together for the good of the country.",
        "We did it last year when we put parents and pupils before party politics and backed the Education Bill.",
        "We did it again last week.",
        "This Party has always believed that strong defence is vital.",
        "So when I saw a big rebellion in the Labour Party, I knew it was right to line up our forces and march them through the division lobby in support of replacing Trident.",
        "And we can be proud that it\u2019s thanks to this Party that Britain\u2019s future defences are secure.",
        "It\u2019s not just in Parliament that we\u2019re changing the way we do politics.",
        "Look at what our candidates are doing, leading social action projects in their communities, getting things done instead of just talking about it.",
        "Those social action projects aren\u2019t just an add-on extra.",
        "They\u2019re at the heart of what our Party needs to be.",
        "**BROWN SPIN**",
        "What a contrast with Gordon Brown.",
        "His idea of social action is dinner with Kylie Minogue.",
        "Now he says he wants to end the culture of spin.",
        "We should be so lucky.",
        "Do you think we\u2019ve forgotten you announcing the same spending over and over and over again?",
        "Do you think we\u2019ve forgotten the budgets when the big changes \u2013 the clobbering of the self-employed and the hammering of pensions \u2013 haven\u2019t even been mentioned by you in the budget speech itself?",
        "Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll be looking out for it next week",
        "And do you think we\u2019ve forgotten the stealth taxes and council tax rises that are hammering every home in Britain?",
        "Gordon, you are not the answer to spin.",
        "You are spin \u2013 and we won\u2019t let people forget it.",
        "**REAL SUBSTANCE**",
        "But our progress will depend not on what he does, but on what we do.",
        "And if last year was all about change, then this year is more about grit.",
        "The gritty determination to say where we stand on the big issues.",
        "To stick to our guns.",
        "To take tough decisions.",
        "And when the right thing to say is unpopular, to say it anyway \u2013 because it\u2019s right.",
        "Take the environment.",
        "Anyone can say they\u2019re green.",
        "It\u2019s easy to do the softer things like ride your bike, visit glaciers and rebuild your house to make it green.",
        "But it\u2019s only clear you mean it when you do the tough things as well.",
        "Like telling the truth about climate change.",
        "The truth is that you can\u2019t be serious about climate change unless you\u2019re serious about aviation.",
        "Everybody knows that.",
        "There\u2019s a price for progress, and leadership is about making that clear.",
        "We don\u2019t have to stop people flying.",
        "But we do have to take action on emissions.",
        "So yes we will curb the growth of carbon emissions from aviation.",
        "Yes we\u2019ll find ways of doing it that are fair and reasonable.",
        "But no, we will not use green taxes as a stealth tax, because with a Conservative Government green taxes will be replacement taxes, not extra taxes.",
        "Every penny we raise in taxes on bad things like pollution will be used to cut taxes on good things like enterprise and families.",
        "Look at the difference between our approach to the environment and Gordon Brown\u2019s.",
        "He says he\u2019s against green taxes.",
        "He\u2019s telling people what they want to hear \u2013 that you can go green without paying the price.",
        "That\u2019s not leadership.",
        "That\u2019s not substance.",
        "It\u2019s the same on the family.",
        "Anyone can say they\u2019re family-friendly.",
        "It\u2019s easy to do the softer things, like talk about how much your family means to you.",
        "But it\u2019s only when you do the tough things that people know you\u2019re serious.",
        "That\u2019s why we\u2019ve said that business and the public sector need to do more to help parents with flexible working.",
        "I\u2019ve also said clearly that this Party backs marriage and will support it in the tax system.",
        "Many people don\u2019t agree with it.",
        "But I think it\u2019s vital, and that\u2019s why I say it.",
        "It\u2019s another challenge ducked by Gordon Brown.",
        "He knows that family breakdown is at the heart of the social breakdown we see around us.",
        "Kids without qualifications.",
        "Teenage pregnancy.",
        "Rising crime.",
        "But Gordon Brown won\u2019t do anything about family breakdown.",
        "We\u2019ve got a tax system that doesn\u2019t recognise marriage.",
        "And a benefits system which does recognise marriage \u2013 but penalises it.",
        "In fact it penalises any form of commitment between two people.",
        "What sort of system is it that pays people to live apart?",
        "It\u2019s got to change.",
        "We\u2019re leading political debate in this country for the first time in many years.",
        "On strengthening families, while Tony Blair pretends there\u2019s no problem and papers over the cracks\u2026",
        "\u2026we\u2019re the ones making the substantial arguments about family breakdown and its effects.",
        "On protecting the environment, it is only because we made the case for annual targets on carbon emissions that we saw the Climate Change Bill published last week.",
        "And on the NHS, while Labour has been closing Accident and Emergency units \u2026",
        "\u2026we\u2019re the ones campaigning against NHS cuts..",
        "\u2026developing the serious ideas to improve our health service by putting power in the hands of patients and professionals.",
        "**LABOUR AND THE NHS**",
        "It used to be said that Labour were the party of the NHS.",
        "Not any more.",
        "Labour are the party that is undermining the NHS.",
        "There\u2019s a simple reason why.",
        "It\u2019s not deliberate.",
        "It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t care.",
        "But it is because of their values and their philosophy.",
        "Labour\u2019s mania for controlling and directing things from the centre.",
        "Labour\u2019s pessimism about human nature.",
        "Their belief that if you don\u2019t tell people what to do, they\u2019ll do the wrong thing.",
        "Labour just don\u2019t trust people.",
        "And the NHS is all about people \u2013 the nurses, the doctors, the cleaners, the therapists, the porters, the many thousands of people who are motivated by one thing above all else: to give patients the best possible care.",
        "Labour don\u2019t trust them.",
        "Instead they\u2019re spending six hundred million pounds a year on management consultants in the health service.",
        "They\u2019ve turned the NHS into a vast, inhuman machine, a pen-pusher\u2019s paradise at the mercy of the management consultants\u2019 latest wheeze\u2026",
        "\u2026dreamt up, rolled out, cut back \u2013 then finally written off when the next ludicrous \u2018strategy\u2019 appears.",
        "Labour have ripped the heart out of our NHS and replaced it with a computer.",
        "Targets.",
        "Reorganisations.",
        "Endlessly asking people to reapply for their own jobs.",
        "Mind-blowing waste in the name of modernisation and efficiency.",
        "But they don\u2019t count the human cost.",
        "I think of the pensioners raising money through the league of friends for their local hospital, just to see it close.",
        "I think of the emergency nurse practitioner in Surrey, still in his overalls, telling me that closing A&E means an hour long drive to hospital for some people, and potentially lives lost.",
        "I think of the young mums told their maternity unit could be closing when they\u2019ve always wanted to have their children in the hospital they love, near their home.",
        "And look what Labour are doing to people who choose a medical career, who have made the decision to give the best part of their lives to looking after us.",
        "Junior doctors who have already spent years working in the NHS, having to apply for their jobs by computer\u2026",
        "They\u2019re not allowed to say what areas of medicine they\u2019re passionate about.",
        "They\u2019re not allowed to describe any voluntary work they\u2019ve done.",
        "They\u2019re not even allowed to send in their CV.",
        "They have to fill in forms on the internet, describing ethical dilemmas in a hundred and fifty words, treated like cogs in a machine.",
        "I don\u2019t think ministers have the slightest idea how angry these doctors are.",
        "Their applications lost as the computer system crashes.",
        "Their future at risk from chaotic central planning.",
        "Their dedication questioned and their morale undermined by the latest mechanical, impersonal, inhuman Labour scheme.",
        "Why are we treating people like this?",
        "Yesterday I met a doctor who after six years of training in the NHS wants to be a surgeon in London.",
        "Instead they\u2019re telling her to be a psychiatrist in Edinburgh.",
        "Why can\u2019t Labour see the harm they are doing?",
        "They have no idea how ridiculous they now look.",
        "We now have the grotesque spectacle of Labour MPs, including the chairman of the Labour Party, protesting pathetically outside their own local hospitals, against their own party\u2019s health policy.",
        "They used to say they would save the NHS.",
        "Now they\u2019re trying to save it from themselves.",
        "What a way to run a health service.",
        "What an absolute and shameful disgrace.",
        "**CONSERVATIVES AND THE NHS**",
        "So let me tell you how we would be different.",
        "There are three things I want you to remember \u2013 three steps on our journey towards being the trusted custodians of our National Health Service.",
        "First, today\u2019s Conservative Party backs the NHS, heart and soul.",
        "We will do all we can to protect and improve it.",
        "No ifs, no buts, no opt-outs.",
        "The NHS is our priority.",
        "Second, we will not repeat Labour\u2019s mistakes.",
        "They came to power and destructively scrapped all the reforms that had gone before.",
        "It wasted time, wasted money, wasted goodwill.",
        "So we will put an end to the pointless reorganisations.",
        "We will wave goodbye to the armies of management consultants with their morale-destroying blueprints.",
        "The next Conservative Government will build on and improve the NHS we inherit.",
        "Foundation hospitals won\u2019t go, they\u2019ll stay \u2013 and we\u2019ll improve them.",
        "Commissioning by GPs is right \u2013 and we\u2019ll make it really mean something.",
        "Patient choice is essential \u2013 and we\u2019ll make it actually work.",
        "The third step on our journey is perhaps the most important.",
        "We will put people back at the heart of the NHS.",
        "We will trust the professionals.",
        "We will get rid of the top-down, centralising, interfering, insulting targets that drive our doctors and nurses mad.",
        "Progressively, patiently, carefully, we will usher in a new era of quality and care.",
        "Where money is allocated on the basis of clinical need, not political priority.",
        "Where hospitals succeed because people want to use them; where they\u2019re not closed by the stroke of a bureaucrat\u2019s pen.",
        "That is our goal: an independent NHS, where we get politicians out of the day to day running of the health service we all cherish.",
        "The NHS is my passion.",
        "Our priority.",
        "We\u2019ll back it.",
        "Build it.",
        "Improve it for everyone.",
        "**SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND PUBLIC SERVICES**",
        "That is what we mean when we talk about social responsibility.",
        "We understand that government doesn\u2019t have all the answers.",
        "We\u2019re optimistic about human nature.",
        "We believe that if you trust people, they\u2019ll do the right thing.",
        "That\u2019s how we will improve the NHS and schools and social care \u2013 trusting the professionals and giving them responsibility.",
        "Delivering first class public services is one of the great tests of modern government.",
        "I believe that this Party is now ready to pass that test.",
        "We have the right approach \u2013 social responsibility.",
        "And we have the right priorities \u2013 like the NHS, schools, families, crime, transport, the environment.",
        "**CLEARING UP AFTER LABOUR**",
        "They are the battleground on which the next election will be fought, and it\u2019s vital we understand that.",
        "Last month, I had the honour of standing with Margaret Thatcher after her new statue was unveiled in the House of Commons.",
        "She didn\u2019t spend her time in office like Tony Blair, fretting about her legacy.",
        "Do you know something \u2013 she achieved more for this country in ten weeks than Tony Blair has achieved in ten years.",
        "She spent her time as Leader of the Opposition developing a clear analysis of what the country needed.",
        "She knew what the battleground was and she knew how to win the war.",
        "In the 1970s Britain faced economic breakdown.",
        "Businesses that couldn\u2019t deliver the goods.",
        "Rampant inflation.",
        "Irresponsible trades unions.",
        "An over-taxed and over-regulated economy that was the sick man of Europe.",
        "Margaret Thatcher focused on these challenges, applied Conservative ideas and values, and engineered Britain\u2019s great economic revival.",
        "The result was something we can all be proud of.",
        "A free enterprise economy \u2013 the envy of Europe and the world.",
        "Today, our country does not face economic breakdown.",
        "Yes, Labour have undermined our competitiveness.",
        "Yes, the economy is over-taxed and over-regulated.",
        "Yes, the next Conservative government must act to promote enterprise and wealth creation.",
        "And yes, we must rebuild the pensions system broken by Gordon Brown.",
        "We instinctively understand these things, and unlike Labour we know how to deliver them.",
        "But the big argument in British politics today is not about the free enterprise economy.",
        "It\u2019s about our society.",
        "Because it\u2019s not economic breakdown that Britain now faces, but social breakdown.",
        "Not businesses that aren\u2019t delivering, but public services.",
        "Not rampant inflation but rampant crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour.",
        "Not irresponsible unions \u2013 it\u2019s irresponsible parents.",
        "And as a recent report from UNICEF showed \u2013 a report which put Britain at the bottom of the international league table for the well-being of children\u2026",
        "\u2026it\u2019s not that Britain is the sick man of Europe.",
        "We\u2019re becoming the sick family of Europe.",
        "So my focus today, and the mission of the modern Conservative Party, could not be clearer.",
        "It is to bring about Britain\u2019s social revival.",
        "To improve the quality of life for everyone in our country, increasing our well-being, not just our wealth.",
        "Yes it means changes for this Party.",
        "And I will not shy away from the changes that need to be made.",
        "But what we are doing is reconnecting with values that inspire us all as Conservatives.",
        "That there is more to life than money.",
        "That there is a we in politics, as well as a me.",
        "And that we are all in this together.",
        "This is a Party committed not just to helping people get on in life, but to helping those who get left behind.",
        "In this Party we admire not just Adam Smith and free markets, but Wilberforce who freed the slaves; Chamberlain who cleared the slums; Disraeli who extended suffrage.",
        "So we must speak once again for the people of Britain who are sick and tired of living in a country that is economically rich but socially so poor.",
        "Quality of life \u2013 that is the modern mission of the Conservative Party.",
        "Just as we helped clear up the economic mess that Labour left in 1979, so the next Conservative government will have to clear up the mess that these Labour politicians have made of our society.",
        "So as the Labour Party loses touch with the people of this country and moves away from the centre ground\u2026",
        "\u2026divided on defence\u2026",
        "\u2026dependent on the unions\u2026",
        "\u2026distant from the daily struggle of paying the soaring council tax bills.",
        "As they forget how hard it is to find a GP who\u2019ll see you out of hours\u2026",
        "\u2026to find someone to look after the kids\u2026",
        "\u2026to get back from work in time for you to actually see the kids\u2026",
        "Let us be the party that speaks for the working people of Britain and says to them:",
        "We\u2019re as fed up as you are with paying a lot more tax and getting little in return.",
        "We\u2019re as fed up as you are with ministers who spin and twist but never get anything done.",
        "We\u2019re as fed up as you are with this government of dashed hopes and disappointment.",
        "But now we can offer not just anger, but hope.",
        "Hope because we have made this Party a contender once again.",
        "Hope because we can lead this country in a new direction.",
        "The pace is getting quicker.",
        "In a matter of months, Blair will be gone and Brown will be here.",
        "Our Policy Groups will complete their reports.",
        "In October we\u2019ll debate them.",
        "Next year we\u2019ll shape them into a programme for government.",
        "By the next election there\u2019ll be a new President in the White House.",
        "A new President in the Elysee Palace.",
        "And then Britain too will have the chance to vote for change.",
        "Let us be ready for that moment.",
        "Let us have faith that this time we\u2019ll do it.",
        "And let each and every one of us in this great Party\u2026",
        "\u2026here in this hall and out in the country\u2026",
        "\u2026resolve today to fight with passion and pride for a better tomorrow."
