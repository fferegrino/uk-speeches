        "Thank you. Thank you very much for that introduction. Good afternoon everyone. Sorry to break up the speed networking \u2013 that sounds like a lot more fun than listening to a speech from me. I think we should probably introduce speed networking into the European Union and then those Council meetings, instead of being nine hour dinners, we could probably crack on and get them done in 90 minutes.",
        "Delighted to be here and delighted to be launching this initiative. I said earlier this month that 2012 has got to be the year when we go for it. The year that we light new fires of ambition in our economy. The year when we get behind Britain\u2019s grafters, do-ers, hard workers and entrepreneurs.",
        "This isn\u2019t something we\u2019d quite like to do; this is something we\u2019ve absolutely got to do because enterprise is critical to this country\u2019s future.",
        "As so often, Winston Churchill put it best. He said some people regard private enterprise as a predatory tiger that needs to be shot. Others look on it as a cow that should be milked but not enough people see it as a healthy horse pulling a sturdy wagon. In other words there is only one sensible and sustainable way to grow your economy and that is through brave people starting and growing businesses, employing people and creating wealth. Now some might say, \u2018Well we agree with that but shouldn\u2019t we just try to consolidate our success stories in big business and let them be the ones to drive recovery?\u2019 And yes of course those businesses are vitally important but more important still is the small business, the new, the young \u2013 the businesses that haven\u2019t even been born yet. Because over and over again studies show that small, high-growth firms are the engine of new job creation and they punch way above their weight. So if we want to make our economy stronger, this is where we\u2019ve got to focus our fire power, on encouraging more people to start up and helping small businesses to grow.",
        "Now we\u2019ve made a start. We\u2019re rolling back the bureaucratic, anti-business culture we\u2019ve had for too many years in this country and we\u2019re creating in its place a real climate for enterprise. Corporation tax has been cut and we\u2019re cutting it further. Red tape has been cut and we\u2019re cutting it further. Enterprise zones have been rolled out including here in Leeds to get the best and the brightest to start up. Entrepreneur visas have been brought in to get the brightest in the world to come here with great business ideas. And of course there\u2019s entrepreneur relief so that those who start their own company can keep a bigger slice of their gains. Now since the election more than half a million jobs have been created in the private sector but this is not, and never can be, a case of job done. So today I want to tell you about two new things that we\u2019re doing.",
        "First, through 2012 we\u2019re running a big national campaign to encourage more people to start up a business. Its core message is simple: there is a business in everyone. So what is the business in you? We need many more people to see themselves as entrepreneurs. To understand that each success story starts with a first step. Anita Roddick \u2013 she began The Body Shop from her kitchen. Richard Branson\u2019s mother found a necklace on a train, clearly didn\u2019t give it back to lost property, but sold it for \u00a3300 \u2013 interesting story \u2013 and that was the start-up capital for Virgin. Starbucks kicked off when three academics, probably with four or five opinions between them, wanted a good cup of coffee in their neighbourhood and they invested a few thousand dollars in a cafe.",
        "Now of course it\u2019s not enough just to exhort people to start up; we\u2019ve got to give them practical help and that\u2019s what this campaign and that\u2019s what StartUp Britain is all about. If you talk to anyone who is starting a business, and they\u2019ll tell you the number one thing they need is obviously money. Now we get that. That\u2019s why we put in place agreements with the banks and targeted government schemes to get more cash flowing to small businesses. The trick is connecting that money to those who need it and that\u2019s what our new online finance finder is going to do. It\u2019s a very simple, very useful tool. Just answer a few questions about your business and the finance finder will tell you where to go to get the money you need.",
        "Another thing entrepreneurs need is good advice. Starting a business is one of the hardest, most stressful things that anyone can do and it\u2019s invaluable to know someone who\u2019s been there and taken those risks themselves. That\u2019s why we lined up thousands of mentors across the country and this campaign is going to connect them with the people who need their advice. But beyond those practical things, what entrepreneurs really need is the inspiration to keep on going when things get tough, as they inevitably do. So thanks to StartUp Britain, a campaign, as has been said, run by entrepreneurs, for entrepreneurs, they\u2019re going to be able to log on and hear the stories of people who\u2019ve done it all before. Now all this is coming together in one place in one campaign online and it\u2019s going to be a real shot in the arm for enterprise in this country.",
        "Now the second thing we\u2019re announcing today is a very simple, very practical idea. It\u2019s about using the spare space that we have in the public sector, in the government sector, to help businesses to grow in the private sector. We\u2019ve heard from so many people who say, \u2018Well I\u2019ve got a great idea, I\u2019ve got a little bit of start-up capital, I\u2019m desperate to get it off the ground but I can\u2019t find the space\u2019. Or, people who say, \u2018I can find the space but we\u2019ve got to sign a three-year lease and we just can\u2019t afford it\u2019. And then of course you\u2019ve got many people working in business during the day \u2013 or in government during the day \u2013 wanting to start a business but not wanting to misuse their office facilities or office computers and so what we need is additional space for them, sometimes space at the end of the day or even overnight. What we need is the British equivalent of the Silicon Valley garage \u2013 spaces that are cheap, flexible and available right now.",
        "Some of these places are already opening up around the country \u2013 in fact I gave a speech in one of them last week. It\u2019s called Hub Westminster. It\u2019s at the top of the building that homes \u2013 that houses New Zealand House and you can rent an evening desk space there for just \u00a340 a month. Then if you decide to take the plunge, maybe quit your job, start your own thing, you can start renting a full-time desk space and hire more as your business grows. So this is a brilliant idea and we want to help expand it.",
        "Now, the British government has got a huge stock of buildings at our disposal. The first priority for the ones we aren\u2019t using is obviously to sell them off, but in the meantime many are going to be sitting idle. So let\u2019s match the capacity we\u2019ve got in government with the need that is out there. Let\u2019s provide office space where we can to those who can use it. So we\u2019ve sent a message right across the public sector to government departments, to agencies, saying, \u2018Give us your unwanted space. That office that has lain dormant for years; the shop that\u2019s been boarded up; the rooms no one ever uses \u2013 the answer is out there: give that space to entrepreneurs for business creation.\u2019",
        "Now the Department of Communities and Local Government have said they\u2019ve got two floors of an office block in Leeds, a large vacant building in Birmingham, another one in Plymouth. In London the Department for International Development has also found some space, so we\u2019re throwing open the doors of government and letting the entrepreneurs in. And frankly this won\u2019t just be good for the entrepreneurs and the business people involved; I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s going to be good for government too.",
        "We\u2019ll have civil servants who will then be sharing the water coolers, the lifts, the corridors with entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs that their policies will affect and I think this will be a good connection between public and private sectors. It could even be that the building we\u2019re in today is available for use. So if you\u2019re in Leeds and you\u2019ve got an idea for a business it could start right here. This is the very epitome of a roll your sleeves up government; not waffling on about the theory of how we can help business or shuffle a bit of money around, but doing something practical that will really help.",
        "So we\u2019re doing all this with optimism and confidence because Britain is a country with enterprise running through its veins. I found this on New Year\u2019s Day when my daughter got me out of bed and said, \u2018I want to make mince pies\u2019. We made some mince pies and she sold them to my protection team for \u00a31 a time. She\u2019s only eight years old; I thought that was a good spark of enterprise! Some of them are still recovering, but nonetheless\u2026",
        "But this is the country that led the agricultural revolution, that led the industrial revolution, that helped to kick start the technological revolution. We\u2019re the country that invented the jet engine, the DNA, the World-Wide Web, Viagra \u2013 almost everything you think of, most of the sports you\u2019ve ever heard of. We\u2019re the country that sells tea to China, vodka to Poland and yes, cheese to France. Enterprise is what we do in Britain so this is the year that more than ever we\u2019ve got to go for it and with StartUp Britain\u2019s help and with all your help, that is exactly what we\u2019ll do.",
        "Thank you very much for listening."
