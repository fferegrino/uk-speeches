        "**QUESTION:**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "If you were Prime Minister today, would you rule out a no-fly zone?\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "**DAVID CAMERON:**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "I\u2019m afraid I would, you know, in our hearts every shred of our being wants to do everything we can to help the Ukrainians in their struggle, and we are helping, we\u2019re helping with weapons, we help with training, we\u2019re helping with refugees, but there\u2019s more we can do on humanitarian aid. But I think we have to be very clear with our friends and allies and people who we care deeply about, we must be clear about what we can do, but I\u2019m afraid we also have to be clear about what we can\u2019t do. That said there are more things that we can do.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "**QUESTION:**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Like what?\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "**DAVID CAMERON:**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Well, I think the process started under my premiership of sending more troops to frontline states in NATO; to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, let\u2019s turn some of those into permanent bases. Let\u2019s be absolutely clear about the strength of Article 5 and our commitment to defend every inch of NATO territory. Let\u2019s do more on humanitarian aid. We achieved 0.7% of GDP in our aid payments, I\u2019m sad we got away from that. I hope we can get back to it. Let\u2019s with the EU leave the Donor Conference, lead the aid effort. Let\u2019s have a dedicated aid minister in the cabinet, doing development. The Foreign Office ministers do a great job, but it\u2019d be good to have someone who\u2019s 100% dedicated to humanitarian aid and development.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "**QUESTION:**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Is there a danger here that this could turn into World War Three?\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "**DAVID CAMERON:**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "What Putin has done is so much more ghastly and awful than many people predicted that I think it\u2019s very dangerous to predict what he might do next. I think the best thing we can do is be absolutely clear about how vital Article 5 is, how vital NATO is, to be absolutely clear about the consequences of that sort of action.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant"
