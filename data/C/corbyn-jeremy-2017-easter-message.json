        "As millions mark Easter around the world, it\u2019s a time to reflect on the challenges we face both at home and internationally \u2013 and what our response should be.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
