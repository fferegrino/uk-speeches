        "[![davidcameron](https://www.ukpol.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/davidcameron-225x300.jpg)](https://www.ukpol.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/davidcameron.jpg)",
        "It\u2019s great to be back at the LGA conference.",
        "And I want to congratulate Sir Merrick Cockell on his appointment as Chair of the Local Government Association.",
        "Today, I want to talk about the big issue of the week \u2013 the reform of public service pensions.",
        "But before I do that, let me say something about local government.",
        "I want it put on record: I think you are doing a brilliant job in challenging circumstances.",
        "I know it was a tough financial settlement.",
        "And I know you are all grappling with some really difficult decisions.",
        "When your budget is being cut, freezing council tax isn\u2019t easy.",
        "But because of the action that\u2019s been taken, by everyone in this room, a typical family in a Band D home will save up to \u00a372 over the next year.",
        "You did that \u2013 and it\u2019s something you should be proud of.",
        "But there will be many more tough decisions in the weeks and months ahead.",
        "And my job is to make your job less difficult, not more.",
        "And I believe, as a government, we\u2019re going some way to doing that.",
        "So much of that bureaucracy that drove you mad and cost you so much time and money in administration \u2013 it\u2019s going.",
        "The Comprehensive Area Assessments, the Place Surveys and Local Area Agreements \u2013 we\u2019ve got rid of them.",
        "Quangos like the Audit Commission and Standards Board \u2013 we\u2019re scrapping them.",
        "And regional Spatial Strategies, Regional Fire Control Rooms, Government Offices for the Regions \u2013 they\u2019re going too.",
        "We don\u2019t need regional government. The public want \u2013 you want, I want \u2013 local government.",
        "What\u2019s more, we\u2019re also phasing out that ring-fencing that made you spend money with one hand behind your back.",
        "In every way we can, we\u2019re rooting out the red tape and regulation and freeing your hands from the grip of central government control.",
        "At the same time as this, we\u2019re actively giving you new powers and freedoms \u2013 trusting you to get on with the job.",
        "I believe that our agenda of localism is one the most exciting things we are doing in government.",
        "For years, the default position of government has been to see a problem and suck more power to the centre.",
        "We want to be different. Very different.",
        "When we see a problem, we don\u2019t ask what central government can do \u2013 we ask what can local people do, what can councils do?",
        "It\u2019s by asking those questions that you arrive at so many of our reforms.",
        "Our new general power of competence means councils can develop property, run new services and own assets.",
        "Our new Health and Wellbeing Boards mean you can take a leading role in developing a public health strategy for your local residents.",
        "And our new Local Enterprise Partnerships has seen many of you take control of your local area\u2019s economic destiny.",
        "These are already gathering real momentum.",
        "Like in Tees Valley, where local councils have pooled their budgets and got together with business to draw up a plan to make that place a hub for green industry.",
        "This is what you do when you get more power \u2013 you get things done.",
        "Another way you\u2019re doing this is through community budgets.",
        "We\u2019re saying to local authorities and local public services: here is the freedom to put all your different strands of cash in one pot \u2013 go and tackle some of most stubborn social problems the way you think is best.",
        "It\u2019s already having an impact.",
        "In Islington, the council, NHS, Job Centre Plus, Probation, Police, housing and voluntary sector have pooled staff and over \u00a36 million worth of resources to give the most hard-to-reach families the most intensive and personalized support possible.",
        "Again, we\u2019re giving you the power \u2013 and you\u2019re getting things done.",
        "So for me, it\u2019s not a question of: should we give councils more power?",
        "It\u2019s: how far and how fast can we go?",
        "And we are not stopping this power shift at the Town Hall.",
        "We are going even further, taking people power to the next level \u2013 from councils to neighbourhoods, communities and individuals.",
        "Whether it\u2019s letting people set up new schools: take over the running of playgrounds, parks and post offices, hold beat meetings so they can ask police officers what they\u2019re doing or plan the look, size, shape and feel of local developments \u2013 we believe in changing the way our country is run.",
        "But let me say this.",
        "Yes, we\u2019re giving you this power. And yes, we\u2019re doing that because we trust you.",
        "But no, that doesn\u2019t mean there shouldn\u2019t be a frank exchange of views between us.",
        "Of course, the only people you have to answer to are your voters.",
        "The same is true for us in Central government.",
        "But I\u2019m happy for you to turn round and say so when you think we in central government have the wrong priorities.",
        "And if I see things you\u2019re doing that I don\u2019t like, I think you should be comfortable if I make my opinions known too.",
        "That doesn\u2019t mean I want us locking horns on an ongoing basis.",
        "In fact quite the opposite.",
        "I hope our relationship can be as constructive and co-operative as possible",
        "But we live in a new world of council power and it\u2019s time for a new relationship between central and local government, based on our new responsibilities.",
        "**Public Service Pensions**",
        "So I\u2019ve said something about the great job you\u2019re doing.",
        "I now want to turn to a job we\u2019ve got to do together \u2013 and that is reforming public service pensions.",
        "Over the past few months, I believe we have been acting in good faith on this issue.",
        "We asked Lord Hutton, a Labour peer \u2013 and a former Work and Pensions Secretary with a brilliant understanding of the detail \u2013 to conduct the Review.",
        "We wanted him to build proposals that would be well thought through and maximise the chance cross-party consensus.",
        "And we have met with union leaders regularly to discuss the issues in a good, open, frank and respectful fashion \u2013 and will continue to do so.",
        "Of course, because it is a funded scheme, the Local Government Pension Scheme is different from other public sector pension schemes.",
        "That\u2019s why we will have a more in-depth discussion with local government unions and the TUC about how we take this into account.",
        "But the broad thrust of the wider reforms we are proposing will affect people in this room and your workforces.",
        "So it\u2019s right that I speak about this issue here \u2013 and it\u2019s right that I speak about it now.",
        "In two days time, a minority of unions will go on strike in opposition to our proposals.",
        "Of course, in a democracy, people can go out and protest.",
        "But the people marching should know what they\u2019re objecting to, and I believe there are some misconceptions flying around.",
        "So today, I want to tell you the three things people need to know.",
        "One \u2013 reform is essential.",
        "Two \u2013 our proposals are fair on the taxpayer.",
        "Three \u2013 our proposals are fair on public sector workers.",
        "Let me take each in turn.",
        "**Essential**",
        "First, reform is essential because we just can\u2019t go on as we are.",
        "That\u2019s not because, as some people say, public service pensions are ridiculously generous.",
        "In fact, around half of public service pensioners receive less than \u00a36,000 a year.",
        "No. The reason we can\u2019t go on as we are is because as the baby boomers retire \u2013 and thankfully live longer \u2013 the pension system is in danger of going broke.",
        "Here\u2019s a key fact.",
        "In the 1970s, when a civil servant say retired at sixty, they could expect to claim a pension for around twenty years.",
        "Today, when they retire at sixty, they can expect to claim a pension for nearly thirty years \u2013 about a fifty percent increase on before.",
        "Now, obviously, more people living for longer is a great development for society.",
        "But more people claiming their pension for longer has a real life impact on our ability to pay for pensions.",
        "Indeed, we are already seeing the impact.",
        "In 2009, total payments to public service pensioners and their dependents were almost \u00a332 billion \u2013 an increase of a third, even after allowing for inflation, compared to 1999.",
        "So what are we going to do?",
        "In the words of Lord Hutton, \u201cthe responsible thing to do is to accept that because we are living longer we should work for longer\u201d.",
        "That\u2019s why we are proposing to increase the age when public sector employees can take their pension.",
        "Now, I know some people say this change should only affect new entrants to the pension scheme.",
        "But I\u2019m sorry, I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.",
        "It\u2019s not just the people who are joining the workforce now who are living longer.",
        "We\u2019re all living longer \u2013 so we must all play our part in dealing with this problem.",
        "**Fair for taxpayer**",
        "The second thing people need to know is that our proposals are fair on other taxpayers.",
        "Under the current system, the balance between what public sector employees pay in to their pensions and what the taxpayer contributes is getting massively out of kilter.",
        "Take, for example, the Civil Service Pensions Scheme.",
        "Today, employees contribute around 1.5 and 3.5 percent towards their own pension.",
        "The taxpayer, however, contributes nineteen percent.",
        "Indeed, in total, the taxpayer currently contributes over two-thirds of the costs of maintaining public sector pensions.",
        "That\u2019s the equivalent of \u00a31,000 a household.",
        "That figure is only expected to rise.",
        "Is that a fair?",
        "I don\u2019t believe it is, especially when people in the private sector are seeing the value of their own pensions falling, their own pension age rise \u2013 and when, according to the Office for National Statistics, the average gross pay in the public sector is now higher than in the private sector.",
        "So we need to rebalance the system.",
        "That\u2019s why from April next year, we are proposing to increase the contributions public sector workers have to make to their pension.",
        "And because we really want to protect the lower paid, we propose not to increase contributions at all for those earning \u00a315,000 or less a year.",
        "**Fair on public sector workers**",
        "Third, our proposals are also fair on public sector workers.",
        "Now I know a lot of people are hearing scare stories about our proposals \u2013 about how we are closing defined benefit schemes and replacing them with defined contribution schemes.",
        "Well, here is the plain, irreducible truth: public service pension schemes will remain defined benefit.",
        "This means every public sector worker will receive a guaranteed amount in retirement \u2013 not an uncertain amount based on the value of an investment fund like most people in the private sector.",
        "Any suggestion otherwise is completely untrue.",
        "And any suggestion that we are stripping workers of the benefits they have already accumulated is untrue too.",
        "With our proposals, what you have already earned, you will keep.",
        "We will protect, in full, the pension you have already built up, and we will maintain the final salary link for these benefits.",
        "What would this mean in practice?",
        "It means the \u2018final salary\u2019 which is used to calculate your pension will not be the salary you\u2019re on now, will not be the salary you have when the new scheme comes in \u2013 it will be the one you have when you eventually decide to retire or leave the scheme altogether.",
        "And for what you have already built up, the age at which you can claim those benefits is not changing.",
        "That part of your pension, those past entitlements \u2013 what they allow you to have, are yours and they will not change.",
        "So those people who are claiming otherwise are not just getting their facts wrong, they are giving really bad advice to teachers, nurses and the police officers who are wondering whether to continue with their pension.",
        "Let me tell you how it is.",
        "Anyone with a public service career ahead of them who carries on contributing to their pension will be better off for doing so. Fact",
        "Defined benefit is staying. Fact.",
        "Your pre-reform entitlements are being fully protected. What you have earned you will keep. Fact.",
        "That\u2019s why I can look you in the eye and say public service pensions will remain among the very best, much better, indeed, than for many private sector workers.",
        "And it\u2019s because we are determined to do what\u2019s fair by people who work in the public sector that we are suggesting other changes.",
        "The public service pensions system today is inherently biased against some of the lowest paid workers.",
        "That\u2019s because, under a final salary scheme, it\u2019s the people who reach very high salaries at the end of their careers who benefit the most.",
        "Yes, these are talented people. And yes, they are hugely important to the running of our public services.",
        "But the way the system works, it\u2019s not the community nurse who retires on a final salary of \u00a328,000 who gets the benefit\u2026",
        "\u2026but the hospital consultant who leaves on a final salary of \u00a3110,000.",
        "Indeed, in some instances, for every \u00a3100 they put in their pension, higher earners can get twice as much out.",
        "Is this fair?",
        "No. It\u2019s not.",
        "So again, in accordance with the recommendations of Lord Hutton, we are proposing to replace the final salary scheme with a Career Average scheme.",
        "This would mean that the lowest-paid do not subsidise those individuals who jump to higher salaries in the last few years of their career.",
        "And it would mean that everyone will get broadly the same amount for every pound they put in.",
        "This is not about saving money. It\u2019s about doing what\u2019s right and fair by you.",
        "As Danny Alexander recently set out, our proposals mean that low and middle income workers will receive a pension that is at least as good as what they have now.",
        "**Conclusion**",
        "Let me end by saying this.",
        "I know why people care so much about this issue.",
        "The provision of good, high quality public service pensions goes to the heart of the kind of society we are.",
        "It\u2019s a vital part of the contract between all those who work in our schools and hospitals, fire stations and police stations, councils and prisons, and the rest of the country.",
        "It\u2019s about saying: you\u2019ve spent your career serving others; so we will look after you in old age.",
        "And I am determined to not just meet that contract, but to strengthen it.",
        "But here\u2019s the truth.",
        "That won\u2019t happen if we delay action, or even worse refuse to act.",
        "All that will mean is a worse pension system in five, ten, fifteen years time as the obligations become unaffordable.",
        "The fact is we will only meet and strengthen that contract through change.",
        "And the changes we propose are a good deal.",
        "They are fair for the lower paid and fair on the taxpayer.",
        "They secure affordable pensions not just now, but for decades to come.",
        "And they mean public service pensions will remain among the very best available.",
        "So to those considering strike action, at a time when discussions are ongoing, I would say to you: these strikes are wrong \u2013 for you, for the people you serve, for the good of the country.",
        "It\u2019s the changes we propose that are right.",
        "Right for the long-term.",
        "Right by the taxpayer.",
        "And most crucially of all, right by you."
