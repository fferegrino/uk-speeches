        "Our [initial opposition and manifesto](https://norfolklabour.com/manifesto-2021/sustainable-norfolk/) position was on environmental grounds and in favour of investing in public transport infrastructure. Over the past eighteen months concerns about the rocketing cost have given an additional dimension to our steadfast opposition to the proposed road.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "In part, but also a failure of a vision by the council as strategic transport authority that genuinely addresses the climate crisis, tackles social inequality (see car ownership stats below for 2011 census \u2013 2021 not yet available but we anticipate being worse due to austerity of past twelve years). It is also ideologically driven in that the ruling Tory administration have a very outdated view of \u201cgrowth\u201d and are not focussed on sustainable and inclusive growth. They love leaving a \u201clegacy\u201d and like 1970s style legacy infrastructure projects such as this road.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "No, we do not agree the road is essential for economic growth. There are greater priorities in the County that would bring sustainable growth such as in integrated and affordable public transport system to get people around the county not just for work and education but for leisure and social life. People will spend money in the local economy if they can access it easily and cheaply. It would also boost sustainable tourism. Our vision for \u2018growth\u2019 is based on the principles of the Green New Deal (eg, [Pettifor\u2019s Case for A Green New Deal \u2013 the Ecologist \u2013 Ann Pettifor](https://www.annpettifor.com/2021/10/pettifors-case-for-a-green-new-deal-the-ecologist/)) rather than the outdated vision of growth that we are being presented with. Norfolk is well placed to develop the renewable energy sector. We face a social care crisis and investment in the social care skills and workforce would pay dividends with the challenge of a rapidly aging population.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
