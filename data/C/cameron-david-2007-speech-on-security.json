        "Very soon, the real battle in British politics will begin.",
        "Tony\u2019s going, and the phoney war will be over.",
        "The British people will have a clear choice.",
        "A choice between two different visions of society.",
        "A choice between two different approaches to running the country.",
        "And a choice between the old and the new politics.",
        "Us against Gordon Brown.",
        "That\u2019s the choice at the next election, and today I want to spell out exactly what it means.",
        "**BUILDING OUR HOUSE TOGETHER**",
        "At our party conference last year I said that getting ready for the responsibility of government is like building a house together.",
        "First you prepare the ground.",
        "Then you lay the foundations.",
        "And then, brick by brick, you build your house.",
        "That is the plan I laid out when I became leader of this Party and that is exactly the plan we\u2019ve been following.",
        "**CENTRE GROUND**",
        "We started by preparing the ground.",
        "We stopped fooling ourselves that we played the same old tunes we\u2019d somehow get a different result.",
        "We remembered the importance of rebuilding that broad Conservative coalition without which we\u2019ve never won in the past.",
        "And we moved this Party back to the ground on which our success has always been built, the centre ground of British politics.",
        "That meant addressing the issues that matter to people today\u2026",
        "\u2026so we became the party of the environment and well-being as well as the nation state.",
        "It meant understanding the real priorities of people today\u2026",
        "\u2026so we put economic stability before up-front tax cuts.",
        "And, vitally, it meant standing up for all of the people all of the time, not just some of the people some of the time\u2026",
        "\u2026so we pledged to improve public services for everyone, not give opt-outs to a chosen few.",
        "Today we\u2019re back in the mainstream of political debate, we\u2019re setting the agenda, we\u2019re winning the arguments \u2013 and we\u2019re winning elections.",
        "Nine hundred more councillors this year.",
        "Breaking through in the north of England.",
        "A forty per cent Party once again.",
        "Our party is once again a force that can change our country.",
        "**THE FOUNDATIONS \u2013 SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY**",
        "The second stage in building our house was laying the foundations.",
        "As I said at our conference last year, that\u2019s not about detailed policies.",
        "It\u2019s about the idea on which all our policies will be built.",
        "Policies without intellectual foundations don\u2019t stand the test of time.",
        "We\u2019ve had ten years of short-term initiatives announced to get headlines in the papers.",
        "People have had enough of Labour\u2019s fast-food politics: they want something more serious and more substantial.",
        "That\u2019s why we\u2019ve spent the last few months setting out, patiently and consistently, the big idea on which we\u2019ll build our plan for government.",
        "That idea is social responsibility.",
        "It\u2019s the idea that there is such a thing as society, it\u2019s just not the same thing as the state.",
        "Social responsibility means that every time we see a problem, we don\u2019t just ask what government can do.",
        "We ask what people can do, what society can do.",
        "That\u2019s the big difference between us and Gordon Brown.",
        "His answer to crime, his answer to education, his answer to everything \u2013 is a top-down government scheme.",
        "Whatever the issue, whatever the challenge, whatever the circumstances\u2026 it\u2019s always the same.",
        "Under Gordon Brown all we\u2019ll get is \u201che knows best\u201d politics, as he sits as his desk expecting a grateful nation to wait with bated breath for the latest master-plan to emerge.",
        "He won\u2019t even commit to giving the British people a say over the EU constitution.",
        "I profoundly believe that it\u2019s wrong to change the way in which we are governed without giving people the right to say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d.",
        "Gordon, the top-down days are over.",
        "It\u2019s the twenty-first century.",
        "It\u2019s the age of \u201cpeople know best.\u201d",
        "Parents know best what works for their kids.",
        "Doctors and nurses know best how to improve the NHS and give patients great healthcare.",
        "Residents know best how to make their neighbourhoods better places to live.",
        "We\u2019re living in an age where people want to control their government, not have their government control them.",
        "Every day in countless ways, people are getting together to work out new solutions to old problems.",
        "They\u2019re getting together online, in community groups, in their workplaces, as friends and neighbours and collaborators.",
        "They want and need a government that\u2019s on their side, that trusts them, that positively wants to put power and control in their hands.",
        "That\u2019s the big difference between us and Gordon Brown.",
        "We get the modern world, he doesn\u2019t.",
        "We trust people, he\u2019s suspicious of them.",
        "We believe in social responsibility, he believes in state control.",
        "**VISION FOR BRITAIN: SECURITY AND OPPORTUNITY**",
        "So we\u2019ve prepared the ground by moving to the centre.",
        "We\u2019ve laid the foundations with our big idea, social responsibility.",
        "And now, with our Policy Groups set to publish their reports, we can move forward to the next stage \u2013 showing what we will build for Britain.",
        "This is my vision.",
        "A Britain that combines collective security with individual opportunity.",
        "A Britain that achieves these things through social responsibility, not state control.",
        "And a Britain where a strong society gives everyone the chance to shape their own life, making the most of all that this amazing country, in this amazing century, has to offer.",
        "Our Society. Your Life.",
        "Collective security and individual opportunity.",
        "That\u2019s the combination that\u2019s right for our times and right for the future.",
        "And it\u2019s a combination that only we in this Party can offer.",
        "First, because we understand that social responsibility, not state control, is the best way to provide security and opportunity.",
        "And second because we understand the deep and important connection between them.",
        "**SECURITY**",
        "This Party has always understood the importance of security, including a strong role for the state where it has a duty to protect its citizens.",
        "Social responsibility means a strong society where possible; a strong state where necessary.",
        "Today we need strong defences to protect our country \u2013 from threats old and new.",
        "That\u2019s why we\u2019re committed to setting up a national border police, with Lord Stevens leading a task force to produce a plan for making it happen.",
        "In the months ahead, our Security Policy Group, led by Pauline Neville-Jones and Tom King, will publish their recommendations.",
        "They will advise us on the steps we must take to protect our country from terrorism, and from the new risks of an increasingly unstable world.",
        "We also understand the need for a strong response to the everyday threat to people\u2019s security that comes from crime and anti-social behaviour.",
        "I believe that Tony Blair\u2019s pledge to be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime is his biggest broken promise.",
        "Being tough on crime is not about soundbites and headlines.",
        "It\u2019s about serious long-term thinking: analysing what\u2019s gone wrong with our criminal justice system, and developing serious plans to put it right.",
        "That\u2019s why I\u2019ve placed such emphasis on the need for police reform.",
        "David Davis and his team have produced a detailed and impressive set of proposals.",
        "We\u2019re working on them with the police, trusting in their professionalism\u2026",
        "\u2026asking them to make the changes that are necessary in return for tearing up the pointless targets and paperwork and giving them the freedom to do the job they desperately want to do.",
        "Security is vital in the economy too.",
        "Conservatives instinctively understand the importance of sound money and sensible economic management.",
        "That\u2019s why it is the absolute expression of our traditions, not the denial of them, when we say that we will put economic stability first.",
        "And that\u2019s why we feel so strongly about the way Gordon Brown has wrecked our pensions system, destroying millions of people\u2019s economic security without a word of apology or remorse.",
        "But our collective security is not just about the economy, or crime, or terrorism.",
        "It is also about the fabric of our society. About wanting people to feel a real sense of belonging.",
        "We believe in building a cohesive society, where Britishness means inspiring people with a love of country\u2026",
        "\u2026not bullying them with instructions to integrate, or insulting them with cheap \u2018flags-on-the-lawn\u2019 gimmicks.",
        "And above all, our collective security is about the one institution in our society which matters to me more than any other.",
        "That is the family.",
        "Why do I focus on the family?",
        "Why am I so proud of the magnificent work that Iain Duncan Smith is leading in our Social Justice Policy Group, with his final report soon to be published?",
        "Because I believe, as I said in my speech to our Spring Forum in March, that the greatest challenge this country faces today is reversing the social breakdown we see all around us.",
        "And strengthening families is the best way to do it.",
        "Let\u2019s be clear about this.",
        "It is simply no use talking about opportunity for all unless we give every child in our country the secure start in life that comes from a stable, loving home.",
        "We are far from that position in Britain today, and turning it around will be the greatest challenge \u2013 and I hope the greatest achievement \u2013 of the next Conservative government.",
        "That\u2019s because ensuring our collective security \u2013 whether protecting people from physical harm, providing economic stability, or giving children emotional stability \u2013 is not just an end in itself.",
        "It is about creating the platform for the great driving force of Conservatism through the ages \u2013 the promotion of individual opportunity.",
        "But I will not allow this Party, or this country, to overlook the connection between security and opportunity.",
        "Only by meeting our collective obligations to each other, and building a strong society, will we create the conditions for every individual to enjoy real opportunity.",
        "Our Society. Your Life.",
        "**OPPORTUNITY**",
        "And what a life it can be if we enable people to make the most of the modern world.",
        "I suppose every generation thinks their time is the most exciting there\u2019s been.",
        "But truly, no generation has ever faced such an extraordinary range of possibilities as we do today.",
        "Of course we can look at the future negatively \u2013 the threats of new weapons, of new and dangerous ideologies; the looming catastrophe of climate change; the fracturing of traditional communities and the growing sense of atomisation.",
        "But I am a determined optimist.",
        "I want us to look at the future positively.",
        "Every year we get closer to curing the great diseases.",
        "There are technologies that will give us the energy to power the world without wrecking the planet.",
        "We have communications which overcome every obstacle not just of distance but of culture \u2013 making one world.",
        "We see the potential of the future in places like South Korea.",
        "Britain took four hundred years to move from an agricultural to a high-tech economy \u2013 Korea has done it in just forty.",
        "There\u2019s no reason why similar miracles can\u2019t happen elsewhere in Asia \u2013 and in Africa.",
        "Peter Lilley\u2019s Policy Group on Globalisation and Global Poverty will have many recommendations for what needs to be done to make that a reality.",
        "The task for this Party is to match our determination to build a strong and secure society with a policy programme that extends opportunity ever more widely\u2026",
        "\u2026with no-one excluded from the possibilities of the modern world.",
        "Here\u2019s how we\u2019ll go about it.",
        "If we in Britain want to be in the fast lane of global progress, we need to improve our own dynamism, our own competitiveness.",
        "That\u2019s the thinking behind Michael Heseltine\u2019s radical proposals for devolving power from Whitehall, so our great cities can get the strong leadership they need to compete on the world stage.",
        "In our economy, we must lead the world in innovation, and stimulate the creation of new businesses and new jobs.",
        "That\u2019s the thinking behind the work of John Redwood\u2019s Economic Competitiveness Policy Group.",
        "But above all, extending opportunity means liberating the potential of our young people, with world-class education at every level.",
        "That\u2019s why we\u2019re developing a robust and radical plan for reforming state schools, addressing both standards and structures.",
        "Bringing rigour to the curriculum and testing.",
        "More setting and streaming, with a \u2018grammar stream\u2019 in every subject in every school, so bright pupils are stretched and all pupils are taught at the right level.",
        "Tackling disruptive behaviour by giving head teachers control over discipline.",
        "And making it easier to set up new schools so we get genuine diversity and parents have a real choice.",
        "Stephen Dorrell and Pauline Perry will show in their Public Services report how in schools, just as in the NHS\u2026",
        "\u2026we will replace Labour\u2019s culture of top-down targets and centralisation\u2026",
        "\u2026with a relationship of trust and accountability between those who use public services and the professionals who provide them.",
        "Last week we unveiled proposals to transform young people\u2019s skills\u2026",
        "\u2026 not trusting in the bureaucracy of the Learning and Skills Council, but with new professional apprenticeships that engage employers and match the future needs of the economy.",
        "Next week David Davis will launch a taskforce to examine the recent fall in social mobility \u2013 and find ways to reverse it.",
        "For us, expanding opportunity means not the backward-looking plans of Labour\u2019s Deputy Leadership candidates \u2013 who only see a future for more state-owned and run housing \u2013 but helping young people onto the housing ladder through a massive extension of shared ownership and the right to buy.",
        "Expanding opportunity means not leaving up to thirty per cent of men in some of our towns and cities languishing on Incapacity Benefit, as has happened under Labour \u2026",
        "\u2026 but our plans to harness the expertise of the voluntary sector in helping people off welfare and into work.",
        "And expanding opportunity means not wasting the proceeds of growth as Gordon Brown has done, but sharing the proceeds of economic growth between better public services and lower taxes.",
        "In all these ways, we will show how we are the Party with the new ideas \u2013 the serious ideas \u2013 to expand individual opportunity in our country.",
        "And we will show we understand that individual opportunity is not something that can or should be defined by politicians in Westminster.",
        "Your life is just that \u2013 yours, not mine.",
        "For many people today, opportunity is not just about more money, it\u2019s about more time with the kids.",
        "It\u2019s about the journey to work, the food the family eats, the state of the neighbourhood.",
        "This is the new politics, a world away from the preoccupations of old Westminster and the political elite.",
        "We\u2019re making this new politics our own, just as we\u2019re setting the agenda on the environment and climate change.",
        "And soon the report of our Quality of Life Policy Group will make another significant contribution to that whole debate.",
        "**STAND UP, SPEAK UP**",
        "Right across the range of issues, our policy debate is about to start in earnest.",
        "We will soon be launching Stand Up, Speak Up \u2013 a chance for everyone in this country to get involved in shaping the next Conservative manifesto.",
        "We hear a lot about political apathy these days.",
        "Well I want all of you here and all our Conservative friends around the country to stand up and lead the way in getting people involved in a massive grass-roots debate on the future of our country.",
        "Let\u2019s show the cynics some energy, not apathy.",
        "**CONCLUSION**",
        "So as we start this great policy debate, we can be clear about the shape of the house we\u2019re building.",
        "It\u2019s designed to deliver collective security, as the platform for individual opportunity.",
        "Security for our society; opportunity in your life.",
        "Not copying New Labour, but learning from its mistakes.",
        "Not abandoning Conservative principles, but applying them in new ways to new challenges.",
        "And in the process making this Party the true force for progressive politics in Britain today.",
        "Our foundations are strong, while Gordon Brown\u2019s are shaky.",
        "Our vision is built on the truth that no politician, no bureaucrat, no government official, can ever achieve as much as a strong society working together.",
        "Social responsibility, not state control.",
        "That\u2019s what we believe, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ll win."
