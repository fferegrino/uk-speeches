        "The violent actions of these men cost Luke O\u2019Connell his life. My thoughts remain with Luke\u2019s family and friends who have suffered an unimaginable loss. I hope the Court\u2019s decision to increase these sentences acts as a warning to those who commit such violent crimes, that they can expect to spend a very long time in prison.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals"
