        "The United Kingdom and Romania share important ties. We are partners in the EU, partners in NATO \u2013 and good trading partners too. Our bilateral trade is growing \u2013 up to a record high of \u20ac3.5 billion last year.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",

        "##  Defence \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",

        "##  EU reform \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",

        "I support the principle of free movement to work \u2013 it is a basic treaty right and a key part of the single market. And Romanians, alongside other Europeans, make a valuable contribution to the United Kingdom in a wide range of fields, from finance to science and medicine.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But it was never envisaged that free movement would trigger quite such vast numbers of people moving across our continent. And countries have got to be able to cope with all the pressures that it can bring \u2013 on our schools, our hospitals and other public services.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Net migration in the UK is running at well over 300,000 a year and that is not sustainable.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
