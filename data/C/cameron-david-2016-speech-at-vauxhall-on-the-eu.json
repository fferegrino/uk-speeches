        "**Introduction**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "There is going to be lots of debate about Europe over the next 3 and a half months.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But the biggest issue on the ballot paper on June 23rd is this: our economic future.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And as I\u2019ve said before, the question isn\u2019t whether Britain could still be a great country outside Europe. Of course we could.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "The question is: where will our economy be stronger; where will our children have more opportunities; where will families have the most security; where will Britain be better off \u2013 in or out of a reformed Europe?\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "I know that as people make up their minds, what they want \u2013 more than anything \u2013 are the facts and arguments.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But I know people also want to understand more about Europe, and in particular the single market.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So today, I want to explain what this market is, how it works, and what its advantages are \u2013 and crucially how it should change in the future, under the agreement I negotiated and what that means for you, in terms of jobs, prices, investment in our economy, and your family\u2019s financial security.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "At the same time, I want to challenge those who advocate leaving to be equally clear about the alternatives that they propose for our relationship with this single market.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Because if there\u2019s one thing lacking in all they have said so far, it is specifics, particularly about this issue.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "What trade relationship would Britain have with Europe? What deals would we sign with the rest of the world? What tariffs would British business have to pay?\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "There are so many people in this country who need answers.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "The farmer wondering if his beef will be subject to duties.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "The factory worker wondering if his company will cut investment.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "The young graduate wondering whether she\u2019ll be able to get a job.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "That to me is the difference in this referendum.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "On the one side, we have facts about how a single market in a reformed Europe makes Britain better off, all drawn from experts\u2019 projections, and other countries\u2019 experiences.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "On the other side, we have unanswered questions.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So as you make what will be the most important decision for this country in a generation, let me take you through the three big advantages of the single market:\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "First, how it allows businesses, like this one, to trade tariff-free with the European Union.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Second, how it removes the barriers that not even the best free trade agreements can completely tackle.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And third, how it enables the European Union to strike the most ambitious and comprehensive trade deals with the world.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And as I do this, I want to turn to the big questions that leave campaigners need to answer.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "**Remain: Tariffs**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So first, selling to a continent full of customers \u2013 500 million people \u2013 tariff-free.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Before we joined, we faced extremely high tariffs:\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "14 per cent on cars.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "17 per cent on bicycles.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "32 per cent on salt.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "37 per cent on china.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Even, oddly, 20 per cent on gloves \u2013 but only 13 per cent on socks.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "This all meant higher costs for businesses and for consumers \u2013 and less choice on our supermarket shelves.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Today, there is one tariff in the single market: and it is zero per cent.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And what it means is this:\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "A British businesswoman can sell her goods in Berlin as easily as she can in Birmingham.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "A lorry that sets off from Sunderland doesn\u2019t have to deal with layers of bureaucracy in every country as it heads towards for instance Salzburg.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And industries that were once struggling to survive are now thriving.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Let\u2019s take your industry: cars.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "For every 100 cars we make, 23 stay here in Britain, 33 are sold beyond Europe \u2013 but the biggest proportion, 44 of that 100 cars, they go to the continent.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Why? Not just because of our proximity.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But because those cars \u2013 made inside the single market \u2013 are around 10 per cent less expensive than if they had been subject to the tariffs that are imposed outside the single market.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And it\u2019s not just the selling that depends on Europe; it\u2019s also the making.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Because in the single market, components are tariff-free, too.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And that is vital to Britain, where 59 per cent of car parts by value are imported.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So as you look at the cars that are lined up here, ready to be shipped, you\u2019re looking at an industry that is completely integrated with the single market.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And that\u2019s good for the people of this country \u2013 it creates 140,000 jobs in the car industry; supporting an extra 300,000 jobs; and generating \u00a312 billion a year for our economy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So many industries benefit from a tariff-free Europe.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Look at chemicals and pharmaceuticals \u2013 nearly 140,000 jobs; worth over \u00a322 billion pounds; selling over 50 per cent of their exports to Europe.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Look at food industry \u2013 370,000 jobs; worth almost \u00a320 billion; selling over 55 per cent of exports to Europe.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So when I hear people argue that, by being in this single market, we are \u201cshackled to a corpse\u201d, I say: you won\u2019t find the people in these industries saying that; or the towns whose employment depends on them.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "It\u2019s by being in the single market that so many of our companies are growing.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And it also helps us attract a huge amount of investment to the United Kingdom.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Of course, businesses invest in Britain for many reasons \u2013 our skilled workforce, our flexible labour market and low taxes.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "They invest because of our effective but low regulation \u2013 one of the least restrictive in the OECD, in fact, despite our membership of the European Union.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And they invest because our economy is strong.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "That\u2019s worth thinking about for a moment.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "When we entered the European Community, back in the 1970s, with high inflation and frankly zero confidence in our economy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Today, 40 years later, our country is much stronger and better off \u2013 with one of the fastest growth rates and lowest unemployment rates in Europe.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Now of course, we have turned round our country\u2019s fortunes through our own efforts \u2013 not least through fundamental reforms in the 1980s.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But when you consider the country Britain is today compared to when we joined the EU, it is hard to sustain the argument that being in has hobbled us or crippled our ability to do well.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Far from holding us back, our membership of the EU is one reason why countries want to invest.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And every day, foreign companies invest \u00a3142 million here in Britain, companies like BMW, Bosch, Ikea, Nissan and Siemens. And of course General Motors.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "That doesn\u2019t just create jobs; it helps us to finance what economists call our current account deficit \u2013 meaning we can pay our way in the world.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And it\u2019s small businesses that are affected as well.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Nearly a third of Federation of Small Businesses members import or export overseas, and 80 per cent of those who export sell to Europe.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And it\u2019s not just those trading directly with Europe; it\u2019s those connected to that process \u2013 in the jargon, in the supply chain: the factory that makes the components for the car company; the local printer who makes leaflets for the factory; the sandwich shop that caters for the printers.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So many businesses succeed, directly and indirectly, because of this free-trade system.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Indeed, 3 million people\u2019s jobs in our country are already linked to it.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And, because of the changes and reforms I\u2019ve secured in Europe, I\u2019m determined that many more businesses will succeed, too.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "During that renegotiation I got some clear commitments: to complete the single market in services, in digital and in energy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "This really matters for a country like ours because over three quarters of our economy is made up of the service sector, and we are one of Europe\u2019s leaders in technology and renewable energy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So the result is clear: more jobs, more investment, lower prices, greater economic security \u2013 and hardworking families better off.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "**Leave: Tariffs**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Those who want to leave aren\u2019t clear about what sort of access that we\u2019d have to the single market after we\u2019d left.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Clearly there would be a strong case for trying to secure full access.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But as the German finance minister made clear last week, if you want that you must pay into the EU and accept complete the free movement of people \u2013 two of the reasons many people cite for wanting to leave the EU in the first place.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Norway is one example of a country we could follow. They have almost full access to the single market.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But they pay into the EU; accept nearly double the number of EU migrants per head that we do and still have to put up with tariffs on some of their goods.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Crucially, they have no say on the rules of the single market, whereas we do.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Now others will say: let\u2019s sign a free trade agreement like Canada is doing. And yes of course \u2013 perhaps we could.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But their free trade agreement is not anything like being in the single market and it retains a number of tariffs and quotas.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Will Canadian farmers have unrestricted exports for their produce? No.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Will Canadian car makers be able to sell their cars in Europe without cumbersome rules on the origin of each part? No.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Their agreement with the EU is over 1,400 pages long \u2013 700 of which are exemptions from free trade demanded by either side.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Now that might work for Canada, which sends around a tenth of its exports to Europe.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But it wouldn\u2019t work for Britain, with around half our exports going to Europe.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Then there are those who will argue that we could pull out of the EU and fall back on World Trade Organisation rules.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But that wouldn\u2019t mean tariff-free trade.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Even with the WTO Most Favoured Nation treatment, we\u2019d be exposed to tariffs of 10 per cent on our cars, 11 per cent on clothes and 36 per cent on average for dairy products. What would happen to jobs in those sectors?\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Of course, each of those three outcomes, access to the Single Market, but accepting fees and migration; a free trade agreement; or WTO rules, all of these are do-able. And people who want to leave the EU should decide which they favour.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But there is another key question. Would Britain get a good deal?\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Now here I want to cut through some of the rhetoric.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Because we have the leave campaigners saying any hint that you think Britain may not get a good deal is somehow \u201ctalking Britain down\u201d.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And we have remain campaigners saying it\u2019s all very difficult and all very hard.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So I just need to present you with the facts, so you can make up your own mind.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "If Britain was to vote to leave, we would have to enter discussions with the EU on what our trade relationship should be like.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And these will be the negotiating dynamics:\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "One nation negotiating with 27 nations.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Britain\u2019s market of 60 million negotiating with a European market of 440 million.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Britain, a country which sells 50 per cent of its goods to a European bloc, compared to a European bloc which sells only 7 per cent of its goods to us.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Those are the facts. I will leave it to you to judge who the balance favours.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "**Remain: Non-tariff barriers**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Now the second big advantage of the single market is that it doesn\u2019t just eliminate tariffs, it eliminates other barriers to trade \u2013 things that are known as non-tariff barriers.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "These are the often more technical rules but they impose hidden costs on businesses.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Things like refusing to recognise the professional qualifications of your staff.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Or saying that your company has to set up a separate legal entity in every single country you want to trade in.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "This is particularly important for Britain, which relies less on goods, which are hindered by tariffs, and more on services, which are hindered by these non-tariff barriers.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We\u2019ve already demonstrated how effective we can be at bringing down the barriers.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "In the 1980s, a lorry load of goods setting off from Manchester to Milan would be carrying 88 separate documents.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Today, thanks to this internal market which we drove forward, they have been replaced with just one piece of paper.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Before the 1990s, airlines could be blocked by other countries from flying where and when they wanted.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Britain helped end that, and that spawned EasyJet, Ryanair and Jet2.com, and opening up the continent to British businesses, students and holidaymakers, making travel much, much cheaper.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Of course it\u2019s not always easy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "There are times when changes to these non-tariff rules can cause us problems. But frankly that\u2019s no surprise when you have an organisation of 28 different members.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But on the big questions, we have a seat at the table to help shape those rules and promote Britian\u2019s industries.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "One of the biggest non-tariff barriers is the ability of countries to ban your product on the basis of often spurious concerns.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "With a seat at the table and enforceable rules, we are able to challenge those things.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And that\u2019s what we did in 2001 when the European Court of Justice overturned France\u2019s bogus ban on British beef.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Without the single market, there are obstacles to selling meat for instance to some of our biggest trading partners \u2013 even our friends, like America.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "How much British beef do you think we sell in America? None. All because of restrictions that are nearly 20 years old.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "That shows just how important it is to be able to shape the rules to suit our interests, which the single market in the EU enables us to do.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Then there\u2019s for instance the financial services, employing 1.1 million people in this country and adding \u00a3133 billion pounds to our economy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "This industry goes way beyond London; two-thirds of financial sector jobs are based outside the capital.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "All have the benefit of being able to trade in the single market of 500 million people without having to set up an office anywhere else other than the UK, because we are in the EU.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Recently, there was move that could\u2019ve forced UK-based companies that clear euros \u2013 a bedrock of our financial services, to move inside the Eurozone.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "That could\u2019ve been deeply economically damaging for our country.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But we had our seat at the table, and we were able to stop it.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And through my renegotiation I\u2019ve made sure a proposal like that can never happen again.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And let me be clear: I am the first to say that there needs to be further reform of the EU.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "My renegotiation isn\u2019t the end of the road for reform.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "It\u2019s another important milestone in our ongoing mission to make sure the EU works for us.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "**Leave: Non-tariff barriers**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Now what about the alternatives?\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We need to be clear.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "If we voted to leave, we could sign the best possible free trade agreement in the world with the European Union, but it still would not come close to giving British companies the access they get to the world\u2019s largest free trade area from the single market.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Why?\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Because \u2013 and this is really important point \u2013 even the best free trade agreements leave many of these non-tariff barriers in place.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "For British firms like this, it would be a return to the bad old days of endless forms and burdensome bureaucracy and, along with losing out on the benefits of a more complete single market, it could cost Britain over \u00a350 billion, according to the London School of Economics.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "That\u2019s not all. Those who want to leave Europe claim we would be repatriating powers.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But leaving Europe would in many ways give us less control:\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We\u2019d still be affected by its rules if we wanted access to the single market \u2013 we just wouldn\u2019t have any influence over them.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Just ask Switzerland.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "There\u2019s a reason their banks base substantial operations inside the UK: they have no agreement that guarantees their access to the single market.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And then there is Norway.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "As their prime minister said only last week: \u201cWe lack influence in important decision-making processes in the EU. We have special arrangements on some issues, but basically we have lost our sovereignty.\u201d\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "That is what the Norwegian Prime Minister is saying outside of the EU because of the relationships they\u2019ve signed with the EU. Now that\u2019s a really important point.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
