        "Fifty years ago John F Kennedy lost his life \u2013 and the world lost an inspiration. Wherever you go in the world today, the three letters \u2013 JFK \u2013 are instantly recognisable. They summon up the very best of politics: energy, optimism, hope \u2013 the belief that a nation united can achieve almost anything.",
        "It was these ideals which came to define the Kennedy Presidency. He demanded that his country rise to the challenges of its time \u2013 and the people responded in kind. Although, his Presidency was tragically cut short, its legacy was felt long after. Civil rights, a man on the moon: both achieved after his death \u2013 but only possible because of the leadership shown during his life.",
        "Tomorrow will be a day to remember with gratitude what President Kennedy\u2019s life still teaches us \u2013 and our thoughts are with the American people."
