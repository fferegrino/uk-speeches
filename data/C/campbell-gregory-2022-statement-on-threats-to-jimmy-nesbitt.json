        "Jimmy Nesbitt is a local lad who has invested in his own community. Those painting threatening graffiti such as this should stop. Their actions are wrong and to be condemned.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I fundamentally disagree with Mr Nesbitt\u2019s position on Northern Ireland\u2019s future but he has every right to express his political views in whatever forum he wishes. He should be able to do so free from fear. That\u2019s a democracy and it\u2019s why I have opposed Sinn Fein all my life as they believed you could justify violence at the same time as doing politics.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "We must be consistent in always opposing violence as well as any threat of violence and attempted intimidation.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals"
