        "Spain and Hanratty set off from London with the sole intention of committing these violent robberies. They inflicted a terrible ordeal on the occupants of the properties they targeted, and the victims will be suffering the effects for a long time. I hope the Court\u2019s decision to increase these sentences can bring some comfort to all of those affected.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals"
