        "It is very humbling to follow so many great speeches. On my own behalf and on behalf of my Edinburgh South West constituents, I too rise to honour the memory of our late Queen. Much has been said of her dedication and her service, but I want to concentrate on her love of Scotland and the love of many Scots for her.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "As the Queen died at Balmoral, and is to be taken first to the palace of Holyroodhouse and then to St Giles\u2019 Cathedral in Edinburgh, Scotland will be the centre of the world\u2019s attention over the next few days. That is breaking with tradition, but those were the Queen\u2019s wishes, and Scotland is honoured by them. The last monarch to die in Scotland was James V, who died at Falkland in 1542. He was, of course, the father of Mary, Queen of Scots, and it was her son James VI who presided over the union of the Crowns. Mary, Queen of Scots is the ancestor of all the Stuarts and, indeed, all the Hanoverians who followed. Elizabeth Stuart, the daughter of James VI, married one of the German electors, and with the demise of the last Stuart monarch in 1714, Elizabeth\u2019s grandson succeeded to the British throne. That is the Hanoverian line, and it can be traced directly back to Scotland\u2019s Stuarts. Our late Queen was keenly aware of that\u2014perhaps that is why she chose Stuart names for her first two children, Charles and Anne. And, of course, her mother was a Scot.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "In 1953, after her coronation, the first place our late Queen visited was Edinburgh, and throughout her reign, she returned to Scotland for important events and, indeed, chose my country to be centre stage during state visits. In 1962, she chose Scotland for the state visit of the King of Norway; in 2010\u2014very memorably for many people of my faith\u2014she chose Holyrood for the state visit of Pope Benedict XVI; and, of course, she officially opened Scotland\u2019s Parliament when it was reconvened in 1999.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Our late Queen embodied the union of the English and Scottish Crowns, which of course is quite different from the Union of the Parliaments and predates it by over 100 years. At a time of change, there are many in my country\u2014particularly younger people\u2014who might prefer a republic to a constitutional monarchy, but that did not in any way prevent the affection our late Queen held for Scotland from being returned in equal measure. Sadly, I never had the privilege of meeting Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, the Queen of Scots, but earlier this year I did have the privilege of meeting our new King. We spoke of Scotland, and I was left in no doubt that he shared his mother\u2019s abiding love of my country.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "As such, before I resume my seat, in honour of his late mother, I want to recite just a few words of Burns\u2019 poetry that I believe may be a favourite of the King:\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
