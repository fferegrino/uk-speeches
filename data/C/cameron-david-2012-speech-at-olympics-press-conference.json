        "It gives me great pride to welcome you all to London on this truly momentous day for our country. Seven years of waiting, planning, building and dreaming are almost over.",
        "Tomorrow the curtain comes up, the spectators arrive and the Olympic and Paralympic Games 2012 can officially begin. I want to set out three things you\u2019re going to see over the coming weeks.",
        "Number one: you\u2019re going to see beyond doubt that Britain can deliver. We\u2019ve delivered this incredible Olympic Park on time, on budget and in real style. 46,000 people have turned a wasteland the size of Hyde Park into an extraordinary city town within one of the world\u2019s most exciting cities.",
        "Millions of cubic metres of soil have been excavated. Eight kilometres of waterways have been laid. A stadium, an aquatics centre, a velodrome have been built. According to Jacques Rogge, the athletes are ecstatic with the training venues \u2013 and he likes the facilities so much he\u2019s staying here.",
        "All around the park a new transport network has taken shape. Dozens of underground stations have been upgraded, capacity has massively increased and all of it is being overseen by a state-of-the-art Transport Co-ordination Centre.",
        "And what\u2019s so great about these Games is that we\u2019ve built not just for the coming weeks \u2013 but the coming decades. When all the fireworks have died down and the athletes have gone home there is going to be a genuine legacy.",
        "A physical legacy \u2013 with a new quarter of London for people to live and work in. An economic legacy \u2013 with businesses getting a big international boost to trade. And a sporting legacy \u2013 with people all over the country inspired to get active and get into sport.",
        "So we\u2019re delivering a world-class Games, a well-connected Games \u2013 and above all a secure Games. Our absolute top priority is keeping people safe. I have personally chaired regular security meetings in the run-up to this and I\u2019m pleased to tell you that all plans \u2013 including detailed contingency plans \u2013 are in place.",
        "There are extra police on the streets of London, in the skies above and in the waters of the Thames. We\u2019ve got our intelligence services working round the clock. And I am proud too that we have some of our finest men and women \u2013 our armed forces \u2013 guarding the Olympics venues.",
        "This is the biggest security operation in our peacetime history, bar none, and we are leaving nothing to chance. All of this goes to show what we can achieve as a country.",
        "And it sends out this powerful message to the world: If you\u2019re looking for a great place to do business, to invest, to work, to study, to visit \u2013 then look no further than Great Britain.",
        "The second thing you\u2019re going to see here is a real sense of community. We always said the success of these Games wasn\u2019t just about what Government does or what business does \u2013 it\u2019s about our people and the welcome they give to the world.",
        "We want this to be the friendly Games \u2013 and already we\u2019re seeing that. When the call went out for Olympics volunteers, a quarter of a million people came forward. 70,000 of them were chosen.",
        "On top of that, 8000 Londoners are acting as Ambassadors for this city. Between them they are volunteering for 8 million hours. So this is not a state-run Games, it\u2019s a people-run Games. It\u2019s about the people of the UK showing a really warm welcome \u2013 and showing respect to all the teams and nationalities who come here.",
        "On that note, it\u2019s right that in 2012 \u2013 40 years on from the Munich Olympics \u2013 we remember the Israeli team members who were killed there. We will be properly marking the anniversary of that tragedy with a special commemoration and every day of these Games we\u2019ll be demonstrating that there is no more diverse, more open, more tolerant city in the world than this one.",
        "The third \u2013 and most important \u2013 thing you\u2019re going to see and feel over these coming weeks is that infectious spirit of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Beyond all the grand ceremonies and great displays, we\u2019ve got to remember what this is all about.",
        "The athletes up at dawn to train. The swimmers in the pool day-in, day-out for years. The children who dream and make it big. The people who come from nothing to represent their nation. Their efforts are the heart of this Games.",
        "Right at the heart of the Village, the words of the British poet Tennyson have been engraved. They read: \u2018To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\u2019 It\u2019s about never giving up, pushing yourself to the limits, relentlessly pursuing glory and greatness \u2013 the best of human endeavour. And it\u2019s this spirit that is going to shine out from London.",
        "We want this to be the Games that lifts up a city, that lifts up our country and that lifts up our world, bringing people together. So we are delighted to host you here in London today and I hope you have a fantastic Games over the coming weeks."
