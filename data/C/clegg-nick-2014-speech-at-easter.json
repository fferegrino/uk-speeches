        "For Christians, of course, Easter is one of the most important festivals of the year. Following Lent, it is a time to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ and reflect upon his life and teachings. And whether you are Christian or not, I\u2019m sure many people can relate to the messages of love, forgiveness and tolerance that Easter represents.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I want to pay tribute to the millions of Christians in the UK who work so hard to put those values into action. What you do enriches our society in so many ways, whether through charity work at home and abroad or your dialogue and cooperation with other faiths across communities.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
