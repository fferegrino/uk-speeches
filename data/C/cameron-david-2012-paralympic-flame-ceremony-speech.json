        "After a fortnight of Olympics withdrawal symptoms, it\u2019s time to dust off the GB flags and get ready for two more weeks of spectacular sport. The London Paralympic Games 2012 are finally here.",
        "Already this is looking to be an incredible event. Ticket sales have smashed records. Some sessions have been sold out for months. Our Paralympic venues are looking fantastic. Our team are geared up to beat the medal count they made in Beijing: 102 medals and second in the table.",
        "Just like the Olympics we\u2019re going to see international friendship, fierce rivalry and the sheer sporting genius of athletes who have trained day-in, day-out for years. But we can\u2019t deny there\u2019s something particularly inspiring about the Paralympics.",
        "Why? Because being a Paralympian takes an extra measure of guts and steel. A lot of the athletes arriving in London would have been told from a young age about everything they can\u2019t do \u2013 and they decided to throw everything into what they can do, whether that\u2019s smashing a ball over the net, running on prosthetics or swimming faster than the rest.",
        "That example \u2013 of overcoming the difficulties you\u2019ve been handed, pushing yourself to the limits, going way beyond the expectations others have set for you \u2013 is truly inspiring.",
        "So I want to wish everyone competing in these Games \u2013 and particularly ParalympicsGB \u2013 the best of luck. The whole country will be cheering you on."
