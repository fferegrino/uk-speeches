        "It is deeply worrying that the Government can decide to end a programme seeking to address racism and discrimination in its own workplaces without saying what it\u2019s going to do to combat it instead.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The Government should have a plan to tackle these inequalities which lead to poor pay, poor career progression, and a lack of diversity at senior levels. Inaction shouldn\u2019t be an option.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
