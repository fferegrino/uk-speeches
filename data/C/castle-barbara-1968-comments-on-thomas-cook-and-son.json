        "Thomas Cook and Son Ltd. are a valuable national asset which must continue to be maintained and vigorously developed. I have every confidence in the ability and determination of the Company\u2019s Chairman, his Board and staff to do this. The transfer of most of the Transport Holding Company\u2019s other existing assets to the new bodies to be set up as a consequence of the proposals in the Transport Bill now before the House may, however, later make it desirable to make new arrangements for the continued control in the public sector of the Holding Company\u2019s holdings in Thomas Cook. This is under consideration.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals"
