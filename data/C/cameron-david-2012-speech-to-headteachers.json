        "Well welcome everyone. It\u2019s great to have you here at Number 10 Downing Street. I\u2019m always \u2013 bit terrified with Queen Elizabeth I looking down on me, prove that anything is possible in life. But a very warm welcome. We\u2019ve got some extremely talented head teachers here, we\u2019ve got my policy aide here. We\u2019ve got Michael Barber who spent many years in this building working for a previous government and is helping us now, also working at Pearson. And obviously we\u2019ve got the Secretary of State for Education on my right. Sir Michael Wilshaw who has kindly agreed to become Head of Ofsted and take on one of the toughest jobs there is in public life, but I think one of the most important and I\u2019m really looking forward to working with you.",
        "The subject we\u2019re going to look at today which I\u2019m very passionate about is the issue of coasting schools. I think we\u2019d all agree that the last government and this government taking very, very strong action to try to turn around schools that are failing. Also, I think this government is doing a lot to celebrate the excellence there is in the secondary state sector and the primary state sectors, really good schools that are powering ahead to show what can be done. But I think there\u2019s a danger in all of this to miss what is in the middle in terms of some schools that are just above failing \u2013 they get left for too long \u2013 and also, I think this is a subject that doesn\u2019t get addressed enough, schools that might be ranked as satisfactory or even actually might be ranked as good schools but that could actually do so much better.",
        "And I think one of the consequences of recent years where we\u2019ve seen some extraordinary stories of turnarounds and new schools in relatively deprived areas and of course Michael for many years ran the Mossbourne Academy in Hackney which is a classic example \u2013 a brilliant example \u2013 of this. We\u2019ve seen schools that were previously failing turned around with incredible results at GSCE and A-level. And that\u2019s prompted me \u2013 but I\u2019m sure many others as well \u2013 to ask the question: if you can do that in Hackney, if you can do that in inner city Manchester or inner city Birmingham, why aren\u2019t we doing that everywhere across the country and actually striving for better results?",
        "Now it\u2019s not just a question of the aspiration of head teachers, or the aspirations of teachers, it\u2019s also about the aspirations of parents and I think our great allies in this agenda as well as \u2013 and we\u2019ll hear about Ofsted inspections and what teachers and heads should do \u2013 I think our great allies in this should be well-informed parents who want their schools to do more and I think try to raise the rate of\u2026 the level of aspiration not just in schools but actually in the home and in society about schools is a very big part of this agenda. That\u2019s enough from me.",
        "I\u2019m going to ask Michael to set out what he\u2019s talking about today and the proposal he\u2019s making and then perhaps Michael will come in and we\u2019ll open it up and please feel free to agree, disagree, challenge, promote, argue or indeed anything else. Mike, over to you."
