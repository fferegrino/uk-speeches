        "Over the last 5 years we have taken the difficult decisions needed to bring down our deficit and restore our economy to strength.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "In 2010, we were ordering equipment for which there was literally no money.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "The total black hole in the defence budget alone was bigger than the entire defence budget in that year.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Now it is back in balance.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "By sticking to our long-term economic plan, Britain has become the fastest growing major advanced economy in the world for the last 2 years.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",

        "Mr Speaker, this is vital at a time when the threats to our country are growing.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "This morning I was in Paris with President Hollande discussing how we can work together to defeat the evil of ISIL.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "As the murders on the streets of Paris reminded us so starkly, ISIL is not some remote problem thousands of miles away.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "It is a direct threat to our security at home and abroad.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "It has already taken the lives of British hostages\u2026\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",

        "\u2026every penny of which is hard-earned by taxpayers\u2026\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "\u2026this government has taken a clear decision to invest in our security and safeguard our prosperity.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "As a result, the United Kingdom is the only major country in the world today which is simultaneously going to meet the NATO target of spending 2% of our GDP on defence\u2026\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "\u2026and the UN target of spending 0.7% of our GNI on development\u2026\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "\u2026while also increasing investment in our security and intelligence agencies and in counter-terrorism.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Mr Speaker, in ensuring our national security, we will also protect our economic security.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "As a trading nation with the world\u2019s fifth biggest economy, we depend on stability and order in the world. With 5 million British nationals living overseas, our prosperity depending on trade around the world, so engagement is not an optional extra, it is fundamental to the success of our nation.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We need the sea lanes to stay open and the arteries of global commerce to remain free flowing.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So the strategy which I am presenting to the House today sets out a clear vision for a secure and prosperous United Kingdom, with global reach and global influence.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "At its heart is an understanding that we cannot choose between conventional defences against state-based threats on the one hand\u2026\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "\u2026and the need to counter threats that do not recognise national borders.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Today we face both and we must respond to both types of threat.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",

        "\u2026and working with our allies to deal with the common threats that face us all.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Let me take each in turn.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "**Armed forces**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "First, the bottom line of our National Security Strategy must always be the willingness and capability to use force where necessary.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "On Friday evening the United Nations Security Council unanimously agreed Resolution 2249\u2026\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "\u2026calling on Member States to take \u201call the necessary measures\u201d against ISIL in both Syria and Iraq.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Mr Speaker, on Thursday I will come to this House and make a further statement responding personally to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "I\u2019ll make the case for Britain to join our international allies in going after ISIL at their headquarters in Syria, not just Iraq.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And I will explain how such action would be one element of a comprehensive and long-term strategy to defeat ISIL, in parallel with a major international effort to bring an end to the war in Syria.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But today I want to set out how we will ensure that our Armed Forces have the capabilities to carry out such a task\u2026\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "\u2026and indeed any other tasks that might be needed in the years ahead.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",

        "We will buy 9 new Maritime Patrol Aircraft, to be based in Scotland at RAF Lossiemouth. They will protect our nuclear deterrent, they will hunt down hostile submarines and they will enhance our maritime search and rescue. And we will buy at least 13 new frigates and 2 new offshore patrol vessels.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "These will include eight Type 26 anti-submarine warfare frigates.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We will design and build a new class of light, flexible general purpose frigates as well.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",

        "\u2026so that by the 2030s we can further increase the total number of Royal Navy frigates and destroyers.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Mr Speaker, not one of these capabilities is an optional extra.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "These investments are an act of clear-eyed self-interest to ensure our future prosperity and security.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "**Counter-terrorism**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",

        "\u2026to ensure they have the resources and information they need to detect and foil plots from wherever they emanate in the world.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So as I announced last week, we will invest \u00a32.5 billion\u2026\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "\u2026and employ over 1,900 additional staff.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We will increase our investment in counter-terrorism police and more than double our spending on aviation security around the world.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And I can tell the House today that we have put in place a significant new contingency plan to deal with major terrorist attacks\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",

        "\u2026and address the causes of the security threats we face, not just their consequences.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
