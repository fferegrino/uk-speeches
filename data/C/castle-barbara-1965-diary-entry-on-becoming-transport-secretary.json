        "At 8.45 pm phone call from Marcia [Williams]. Could I come down and see the PM? Harold [Wilson] waved me into his room, boyish and slightly dishevelled. _\u201cMay I open my heart to you? You and I ought to talk more, only I\u2019m so busy and you are, too. Have a whisky or brandy?\u201d_. When I said that I\u2019d love a brandy, he said, _\u201cit\u2019s the only thing that keeps me going. Fortunately I have a most intelligent doctor who prescribes it for me. It does something to my metabolism\u201d_.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",

        "_\u201cI always knew that Tom [Fraser] was weak, but I was saddled with a shadow Cabinet, every one of whom expected a job\u201d he went on, \u201cI must have a Minister of Transport who can act. Tom has got a very strong Permanent Secretary whom Churchill got rid of in the Cabinet secretariat and brought in Burke Trend (though I\u2019ll get rid of Helsby before I\u2019m through). I am convinced he has killed integration. But we have got to have an integrated transport policy. I can\u2019t hold the Party otherwise. And the Party is key to everything. We have offered Tom all sorts of advisers but he doesn\u2019t know how to make use of them. Unless you accept my offer the reshuffle can\u2019t take place. I hope you will, but, Barbara, if you say no I shan\u2019t hold it against you. I know what you feel about Overseas Development, but I want you on the home side. I think you are the best person we have got. I want you to be Minister of Transport\u201d._\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
