        "University isn\u2019t for everyone. Sometimes vocational training is better \u2013 an apprenticeship or a course other than a degree.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "But it is important that, if you aren\u2019t considering university, it\u2019s for the right reasons.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I want to make sure not a single one of you is being put off a degree because you think it\u2019s something you can\u2019t afford.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I\u2019m sure you know that, a few years ago, government took the decision to allow universities to raise their fees.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "There was a fair amount of anger about that.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "The previous government had introduced fees, increased them and then commissioned a review into raising them again.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "But what matters to me now is that you know you can still afford to go to university \u2013 and that you don\u2019t let the myths that have emerged crowd out the facts.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I made absolutely sure that it wouldn\u2019t turn a degree into a luxury for the very rich.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I made sure that no student pays a penny up front \u2013 you don\u2019t pay anything back until you leave university, get a job and you\u2019re earning at least \u00a321,000.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I made sure that your repayments depend on your salary \u2013 so, if you earn less, you pay back less every month.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I made sure that, if you don\u2019t earn enough to pay it back, eventually the money you owe is written off.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I made sure it\u2019s actually easier than before for disadvantaged young people to get a degree by increasing the grants and support that\u2019s available and by forcing universities to open up their doors and attract more students from lower income homes.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I understand why, when I said these things at the time, people were sceptical. That certainly wasn\u2019t helped by some of the wild predictions being thrown around: student numbers would plummet; university places would need to be slashed; for thousands of Britain\u2019s young people a university degree would become a thing of the past.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "But not only have these predictions failed to materialise \u2013 the exact opposite has happened.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "We now have the highest application rates ever.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "More young men and women are going full-time to university than ever before.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "A higher proportion of students from poorer backgrounds are going than ever before \u2013 18-year-olds from disadvantaged homes are actually 70% more likely to enter higher education than they were 10 years ago.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Entry rates for students from nearly every ethnic minority are at their highest level ever.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "So to all of you, to each and every one of you: if a degree is what you want, you can still have it \u2013 you\u2019ve just got to work hard. We\u2019ve even removed the arbitrary cap on the number of university places available so as many people who want to go, can.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "To the mums and dads in the room: if you\u2019ve always hoped to one day see that framed graduation photo of your son or daughter on your mantelpiece \u2013 you can still have it.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Whatever you heard in the past, don\u2019t let it lower your sights for the future.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "University may not be for everyone, but it is open to everyone.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Getting a degree depends on ability, not ability to pay.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "The highest ever application rates. More people doing full-time courses than ever before. A higher proportion of young men and women from disadvantaged backgrounds going. Higher grants to help the poorest students. No one paying back a penny until they\u2019re earning a decent wage. And, if they can\u2019t afford it, no one paying a penny back at all.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Forget the myths; be led by the facts, and make the right decision for you.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals"
