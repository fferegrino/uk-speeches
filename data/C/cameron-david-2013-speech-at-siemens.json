        "**Prime Minister**",
        "Thank you. Well, thank you for the welcome and it\u2019s great to be here at Siemens, great to be here in Lincoln. And I think there\u2019s lots of good reasons for being here because what I want to talk about very briefly today is our economy and how I believe our economy is on the mend. I think it\u2019s getting better, I think it\u2019s improving. It\u2019s still early days; it\u2019s still hard work. And one of the reasons it\u2019s getting better is businesses like yours.",
        "I think we all know that in this country we became too reliant on financial services, too reliant on the south of England. We needed to do more to make things again, design things again, export things again and that is exactly what you do here at Siemens. This is a business that exports over 90% of what you do. You\u2019re helping Britain compete and succeed in the global race. And you\u2019re also helping in other important ways in that you are helping train young people.",
        "You take on some 15 apprentices every year but you don\u2019t just do that, you support an engineering school at the university and you\u2019re starting up a UTC \u2013 a University Technical College \u2013 to help give young people education and training that will give them the ability to work in great businesses like this. So I think it\u2019s a good place to come and visit, to come and hear about what you do, because I think it\u2019s absolutely vital we continue the work of mending our economy.",
        "Now, I\u2019m not going to stand here and say that the job is done or even half-done. I\u2019m not going to say that everything is being fixed, but what I will argue is that we\u2019re making some progress. We said we are going to have to deal with the deficit, which was one of the biggest in the world when we came to office, and we\u2019ve paid down a third of that deficit. We said we needed more jobs in the private sector. Of course, we\u2019ve lost jobs in the public sector \u2013 that was inevitable when you have to make cuts \u2013 but we created something like 1.3 million jobs in the private sector. We said that we need new small businesses starting up as the engine of growth, and we\u2019ve seen some of the fastest rates of new businesses growing in our country in recent years.",
        "So I think the economy is on the move, it is on the mend, but we have got a long way to go. And we\u2019re only going to keep improving it if, actually, we back people who work hard, who want to do the right thing, and help them get a good place at school, get a good apprenticeship, start their own business and make something of their lives. And that\u2019s what this government should be all about, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on \u2013 not anything else, but focused on helping people with their aspirations to get a good job, to make something of their lives and to back businesses like this.",
        "Anyway, I promised no long speech from me so that is it from me. It\u2019s now your questions and my attempt to answer them. And you can ask about anything you like. It doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll answer, but I\u2019ll have a go. So who wants to go first? Just put your hand in the air and there are roving microphones.",
        "**Question**",
        "In the UK we\u2019re an importer of energy. I\u2019m just wondering what the government\u2019s policy is to make sure that we don\u2019t have the lights turned off.",
        "**Prime Minister**",
        "Well, I think energy security is absolutely vital. It\u2019s one of the tasks of government to make sure we\u2019ve got plentiful supplies of energy and that it\u2019s not too expensive. And we\u2019re going through a big change right now. You know, our old nuclear power stations are running out of time and being switched off. We should become less reliant on coal for environmental and other reasons. So we have to put a lot of investment into our energy industries.",
        "And what we\u2019re seeing is, first of all, we\u2019ve got a good contribution from gas in our country. We\u2019ve still got a lot of reserves of gas in the North Sea and we\u2019ve got pretty secure imports of gas from different parts of the world; we\u2019re not reliant on any one part of the world. We\u2019re not like some countries that get so much of their gas from Russia; we hardly get any of our gas from Russia. So I think we\u2019ve good secure supplies of gas.",
        "We\u2019re going to invest in new nuclear energy. We\u2019ve got Hinkley Point, where a decision I think will be made quite soon and I hope it\u2019ll be a positive one to have a brand new nuclear power station. And I think it\u2019s also important alongside gas, alongside nuclear, to make sure we also invest in some of the renewable technologies. Now they\u2019re not going to be all of the answer, of course not, but I think to make sure we get some of our energy from on and offshore wind and that we look at some of the other technologies \u2013 wave and tidal power \u2013 I think it\u2019s very sensible for a country like ours.",
        "So what we\u2019ve done, as a government, is actually set out a pretty clear framework. So if you\u2019re an investor into say offshore wind in the North Sea, and we have 70% of Europe\u2019s offshore wind capacity here in the UK, you know that if you build your plant before the end of 2017 you know exactly what you\u2019re going to be paid for the next 20 years.",
        "So Siemens are a big investor in this area. I recently went to the opening of the largest offshore wind farm anywhere in the world, which is called the London Array off the coast of Kent, and we hope that Siemens will go on investing in this technology. It\u2019s not the whole answer but it\u2019s part of the answer.",
        "So a mixture of gas, of nuclear, of renewables I think can make sure we have plentiful supplies of energy. But we\u2019re going to make doubly sure by having something called a capacity payment, so we\u2019re going to introduce a system where we very openly buy a little bit more electricity than we need effectively \u2013 a bit more generating capacity than we need \u2013 so that we have a buffer, just in case demand rises faster than some people predict. So I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll solve that problem and make sure we keep the lights on and can supply industry and consumers with plentiful supplies of energy.",
        "**Question**",
        "On an almost directly-related topic, we\u2019ve been waiting in Siemens with bated breath for the Hull announcement. Kind of would you like to say \u2018yes\u2019 today?",
        "**Prime Minister**",
        "Well, I would love to hear a \u2018yes\u2019 today. Look, I think this is a great opportunity, not just for Siemens, I think it\u2019s a great opportunity for Britain. I think if you look at the Humber Estuary you can see that that has an opportunity, if you like, to be a sort of Aberdeen of wind. I mean, you\u2019ve got Aberdeen with the offshore oil industry. I think that Humberside, the Humber Estuary, can be a real hub of investment in industry for the offshore and onshore wind.",
        "So, it\u2019s Siemens\u2019 decision whether they go ahead with this plant in Hull. All I can say is I think the government\u2019s done everything it possibly could in terms of making available finance, in terms of explaining how the energy market is going to work, in terms of giving guarantees against future changes of policy. I\u2019ve even rung up the Chief Executive on one or two occasions, so it\u2019s \u2013 in the end it\u2019s a commercial decision for Siemens, a commercial business.",
        "But I think the framework for the energy industries in the UK is probably as clear as anywhere in the world. And you see that from overseas investors who are investing in our nuclear industries, our offshore wind industries, other industries. They say, \u2018You\u2019ve set out what the regime is for getting your payments and so it\u2019s now up to us to spend the money.\u2019 So I hope it\u2019ll be a yes and I think we\u2019ll find out maybe today maybe tomorrow.",
        "**Question**",
        "You\u2019ve talked about energy security. I wonder what your view is on fracking, particularly in the more sensitive areas of the country like Surrey and Dorset.",
        "**Prime Minister**",
        "Well, I\u2019m in favour of fracking. I think \u2013 look, if you look at the big picture, what do we need to do in our country to be a success, right?",
        "We live in a very competitive world. You\u2019ve got the rise of India, the rise of China, these great economies powering ahead. How are we in Britain going to be a success story in the 21st century just like we were in the 20th century? Well, we\u2019re going to be a success story if we play to our strengths, if we invest in great businesses, if we keep up with science and technology, if we invest in our great universities, if we go on inventing things. But as well as that, you\u2019ve got to exploit the new industries and you\u2019ve got to make sure your energy prices aren\u2019t rising ahead of your competitors.",
        "Now, the unconventional gas gained by so-called fracking; if you look at what\u2019s happened in America I think there\u2019s a real lesson for us here in the UK. In America they are now almost self-sufficient in gas. Their gas prices to business are now less than half as much as ours are and the reason for this is they have put a lot of investment into unconventional gas. The figures are actually quite frightening. Europe as a whole has 75% as much unconventional gas as America, so we\u2019ve got less in Europe than America. But whereas they are digging 10,000 wells a year, so far in Europe we\u2019ve dug just 100, so we are way behind.",
        "So I am in favour of fracking. The government is making it easier. We\u2019ve set up an office of unconventional gas. We\u2019re trying to streamline the permissions and the permits that you need. But, of course, there will be sensitivities. We are a relatively crowded island, whereas obviously in, you know, North Dakota in America it\u2019s been easier to dig wells when you\u2019ve got fewer people living on each part of your country, but we should be able to take advantage of this. So, let\u2019s streamline the process; let\u2019s make it possible.",
        "And then of course there will be a public debate locally, but I think one of the ways we can get over this \u2013 and I have been making sure we do this \u2013 one of the ways we can get over this is if local communities can see the benefit themselves. And so, what we\u2019ve said is for every well dug there should be an immediate \u00a3100,000 payment to the local community.",
        "Now, that should be just the start, because of course if you hit unconventional gas supplies and you start to exploit them, that will generate a lot of revenue. And I think the way to get over \u2013 some places, obviously, it won\u2019t be appropriate because of the amount of people living there and all the rest of it but, otherwise, I think the way to get over public concern is to say there\u2019ll be real community benefits, and not just benefits going to your local council, but benefits going to your parish, going to your district, going to your \u2013 effectively, to yourself, as well. I think if we do that, people will see, \u2018Okay, there are downsides of this, there are upsides, but I am going to have a personal investment in it.\u2019 And I think if we do that we can make sure the unconventional gas revolution comes to the UK, and that\u2019ll make us more competitive and give us more secure and cheaper supplies of energy at the same time.",
        "**Question**",
        "There\u2019s a projection for the NHS over the next six or seven years, that there\u2019s going to be a serious shortfall in the funding. How do you intend to cover that?",
        "**Prime Minister**",
        "Yeah, very good question; I mean, I think this is a real test for any government, frankly. We got in three years ago with this budget deficit, so what we were spending was much more than what we were getting in taxes \u2013 in fact, it was worse than almost anywhere in the world. So, we had to make some cuts. And, actually, as a government, we chose not to cut the NHS. My view was the NHS is too precious; we all rely on it, our families rely on it, so there should be and there will be in this parliament, modest increases in NHS spending.",
        "But frankly, even modest increases in NHS spending aren\u2019t really enough to cope with the pressures on the NHS, because we\u2019re an ageing population, we\u2019re living longer, there are new treatments coming along that are expensive. So, as you say, sir, there is a funding challenge.",
        "How do we meet that? Well, I think the first thing we have to do is try and make sure that we\u2019re spending every penny as wisely as we possibly could, and that\u2019s why one of the things we did in the recent spending announcement is actually we took some NHS money and we gave it to local authorities to spend on social care, to spend it on helping get those people who are blocked in hospital beds, costing the NHS a fortune, who could be better off at home or in a care home properly looked after.",
        "So, I think if we\u2019re more efficient, if we spend the money wisely, I think we can make sure that the NHS deals with the pressures on it. But it\u2019s not going to be easy. And obviously, today you hear the news that we\u2019ve looked into \u2013 or the NHS has looked into the 14 hospitals with the highest unexplained death rates, and, you know, I am a big fan of our NHS. I love our NHS. I never want to see any harm come to our NHS but, frankly, we don\u2019t serve our NHS if we cover up wrongdoing and problems. We\u2019ve got to look at those problems, we\u2019ve got to look at any instances of poor levels of care or poor management, and we\u2019ve got to deal with them, and I don\u2019t think the last government did enough of that. I think that they sort of said to the inspectorates, \u2018Don\u2019t give us the bad news, I don\u2019t want to know;\u2019 you know, \u2018Talk to the hand, the government doesn\u2019t want to hear.\u2019",
        "I do want to know. If there are things going wrong at, say, Stafford Hospital, or things going wrong at any Lincolnshire hospitals, we need to hear about that, we need to send in teams to help turn them around, we need to make sure people get a good service. Now, it will be testing, meeting this funding challenge but, actually, if we spend the money wisely \u2013 small, real-terms increases when other public services are taking spending reductions \u2013 I think we can deliver a really good NHS.",
        "**Question**",
        "You mentioned our apprentices, and we are very proud of the apprenticeship programme at Lincoln. Recently, Siemens in Lincoln took part in one of your programmes at the Employer Ownership of Skills programme; we had a very successful pre-employment training programme in Lincoln. I just wonder if you can assure us that you will make sure that red tape and bureaucracy won\u2019t descend upon employers away from the Skills Funding Agency, because there is some indications that that might be going to happen.",
        "**Prime Minister**",
        "I think this is a real worry. I mean, businesses like yours take on apprentices every year, and that is good for you and it\u2019s good for the country; it\u2019s good for the young people concerned. And there have been something like 1.2 million apprentices taken on since the election; we have put a lot of money apprentices, we\u2019re very keen on the programme. But I think for big businesses like yours, it\u2019s one thing coping with the paperwork and the bureaucracy. For smaller firms, it can be just a no-no; they decide, \u2018I don\u2019t want to go near this.\u2019",
        "So, what we\u2019ve done is create a more streamlined system. We have said to big businesses like yours, \u2018You don\u2019t have to partner with a training organisation to run these apprenticeships; you can run your own schemes and do it your own way.\u2019 And we have said to small firms, \u2018If you haven\u2019t taken on an apprentice before, we\u2019ll give you a bounty \u2013 we\u2019ll give you a bonus, for taking on your first apprentices.\u2019 So, I think that bit we can get right.",
        "The bit I\u2019m more concerned about \u2013 and it was very interesting talking to some of the apprentices here this morning \u2013 is I still don\u2019t think we are getting it right in school, explaining to young people what are the career options. I don\u2019t blame teachers for this, in a way; most teachers, they went to school, they did their A-levels, they went to university. They\u2019re very familiar with that path, but I don\u2019t think we do enough to say to young people that you can get an apprenticeship at 16, you can get a different sort of apprenticeship at 18, there are now higher-level apprenticeships which are the equivalent of a university degree, there are all these earning and learning options aside from the A-level and university option, and I think we need to do better at that. And I think businesses can help us do that by getting into schools and telling young people early on what are the options.",
        "But I think apprentices should be a major growth area for Britain. You know, this is a German company, and I\u2019m not embarrassed to say it: I think the Germans have done apprentices better than the British. There are lots of things the British do better than the Germans, of course \u2013 football, cricket, even tennis, now, fortunately \u2013 but this is something we can learn from the Germans. They have a fantastically low youth unemployment rate; so do the Dutch. We\u2019re some way behind that. We\u2019re ahead of the Spanish and the Italians and some others, but we can learn more from the Germans when it comes to apprenticeships.",
        "**Question**",
        "You mentioned about apprentices. What\u2019s being done after the training from your point of view at the moment, and what needs to be done, to ensure the skills stay in the country, within jobs and within business?",
        "**Prime Minister**",
        "Well, how do we keep the skills in the country once you\u2019ve trained them up? We have got to do more to help businesses. So, you know, if we want to rebalance this economy we don\u2019t want to see less financial services \u2013 it\u2019s a good industry, something Britain\u2019s good at \u2013 but we want to see more manufacturing, more technology, more aerospace, more in the auto industry.",
        "How do we do that? Well, we\u2019ve got to go through all the things that manufacturing and technology businesses want from the government. Now, I would say there are about three or four things. You want support for apprenticeships because they\u2019re vital for you, so the government\u2019s putting money into apprenticeships. You want support for research and development to develop new products, so we have a tax credit specifically for every pound you spend on research and development. Businesses need competitive and low tax rates, so even at a time of difficult public spending and tax decisions, we have taken the British rate of corporation tax down to 20%, which means that you pay less corporation tax here in Britain than you do in any other G7 or G8 or in fact, I think, G20 country, so we can say to companies like Siemens, \u2018Invest more in Britain. Build more in Britain. This is a good place to work.\u2019 Some areas of the country need help more than others, so Enterprise Zones have been another way of encouraging businesses to expand and invest here.",
        "And then I think the last thing that manufacturing businesses need \u2013 you\u2019ve got to move product around. It\u2019s not just having access to broadband; you need those physical networks, so we need to invest more in roads, in railways, in port infrastructure, all of which is happening in the UK, again in spite of the cuts. You know, we cut the police by 20% \u2013 very difficult decision to make. Actually, I think the police have coped brilliantly with it; they have made themselves more efficient, we haven\u2019t seen a big reduction in police officers. But, as a result, we \u2013 as a result of difficult decisions like that, we have been able to spend money on capital \u2013 on roads, on railways, on port infrastructure \u2013 that will make us more competitive and enable us to win.",
        "So, all those things, and I expect some of the people in your firm could think of some other things we should be doing as well. But I think that would be a good start.",
        "**Question**",
        "Is the NHS safe in your hands? I mean, clearly we\u2019re going to have some revelations from the Keogh review today; what are you going to do to make things better, and when will it be safe for people to go back to hospital in Lincoln?",
        "**Prime Minister**",
        "Well, first of all, the NHS is completely safe in this government\u2019s hands. We absolutely believe in it, we have invested in it; whereas we\u2019ve had to cut some other public services, we\u2019ve increased NHS investment every year. We should, at the same time of pointing out the difficult things in our health service, we should point out the success stories. Mixed-sex wards are almost abolished, infection rates in hospitals are now down at record lows, waiting lists and waiting times are in a good and reasonable place.",
        "There\u2019s much to celebrate in our NHS, and I love our NHS and I never want to do it any harm, but we don\u2019t serve our NHS by covering up problems and difficulties, and clearly there are some hospitals with too-high mortality rates. It\u2019s right to investigate them and it\u2019s right also as the Health Secretary\u2019s done today to identify those hospitals where we\u2019re going to put them into special measures, send in help to turn them around, and make sure they go back to providing the very best service.",
        "That\u2019s what\u2019s happening today. It\u2019s right to highlight problems where they are, but they\u2019re being dealt with, and people can know that they have a good National Health Service that they can be proud to use and proud to see improved at the same time.",
        "**Question**",
        "Prime Minister, in light of the release of the BBC\u2019s Annual Report, do you think it\u2019s right that taxpayers are legally required to pay the licence fee while BBC executives are receiving pay-offs of nearly \u00a31 million?",
        "**Prime Minister**",
        "Well, I think the BBC has to be very careful with the money that it spends. The BBC is in a unique position because it has the licence fee. I support the licence fee. But going with the licence fee is the responsibility to spend that money wisely, and I think it\u2019s quite clear some of the BBC pay-offs have been too high and there hasn\u2019t been enough rigour in this whole process, as was demonstrated in front of the Select Committee, and they need to be more rigorous in the future.",
        "The BBC has strong public support, but they won\u2019t keep that support unless they spend the money wisely.",
        "**Question**",
        "It\u2019s a question that must be on everybody\u2019s lips, right, and what sort of message does it send out that the politicians or the MPs are looking at 10% pay rises when we\u2019re seeing cuts in public spending and armed forces? And people like ourselves, you know, that we could only wish for a 10% pay rise. But I\u2019d like your opinion.",
        "**Prime Minister**",
        "I agree, it is \u2013 round of applause for that man. I agree. I don\u2019t think it is appropriate. I mean, what happened in the last parliament, just so we remember, there was the scandal about expenses, and the last government decided to make the body that decides MPs\u2019 pay completely separate and independent from Parliament. So it makes a decision.",
        "But I\u2019ve said very clearly to them, including in my office, you know, you can\u2019t propose a pay increase at the time when public sector workers have been told it\u2019s a 1% pay increase and that\u2019s it. You can\u2019t suggest that. And, secondly, whatever you do, whatever you suggest and whenever you try and implement it, you\u2019ve got to cut the cost of politics rather than increase it.",
        "Now, I think there are costs in politics that we could reduce. There are still excesses in the system. And so I\u2019ve said to that body \u2013 and they haven\u2019t made a final decision; this pay rise is not written down in stone, it\u2019s not being implemented, there\u2019s a consultation going on. I\u2019ve said to them, \u2018Go away and cut the cost of politics, and don\u2019t introduce a pay rise at the time when people are suffering public sector pay restraint.\u2019 And I think that is the right answer.",
        "So we\u2019ll have to see what they say, but they\u2019ve had a pretty clear message from all three party leaders pretty much saying the same thing to them. And they have got time to think again.",
        "**Question**",
        "You\u2019ve mentioned the potential Siemens investment for the Humber. You\u2019ve even said an announcement could be expected maybe today, maybe tomorrow, in your words. I\u2019d like you to clarify that. But I\u2019d also ask you as a government, do you think you\u2019ve done enough to attract this company into this country?",
        "**Prime Minister**",
        "Well, first of all, it\u2019s up to Siemens, their decision and the timing of their decisions. That\u2019s not under my control. What is under my control is to say to Siemens we welcome your investment into the UK, we back your business, we support your apprenticeships, we back you with tax credits, we\u2019ve given you the lowest corporate tax rate you could possibly expect, we\u2019re a big fan of your company and we want you to do more here. It\u2019ll be their decision. We have to be competitive with other countries. But as I said, I think the Humber Estuary is right for that sort of development.",
        "But let\u2019s be clear, you know, Britain has got many strengths when it comes to business and industry, and we need to play to all those strengths. As I said, there\u2019s a lot of excitement in our universities, there are a lot of auto industries investing in this country right now. If you look at the British car industry, I\u2019m proud; I\u2019ve got my Jaguar Land Rover cufflinks on from another visit just like this. You know, we\u2019ve got Jaguar Land Rover booming in Britain, we\u2019ve got Honda, Nissan, Toyota, all expanding in Britain. BMW, one of your German sister companies, making Minis just outside my constituency, which wherever I travel in the world I see these fantastic examples of British design and manufacture running round the streets.",
        "So there\u2019s lots to celebrate in terms of Britain\u2019s industrial future, and this government is absolutely behind backing it every step of the way.",
        "**Question**",
        "Exporting is second nature to this business, but we know how difficult it is. What\u2019s the government doing to encourage and help new exporters from the UK?",
        "**Prime Minister**",
        "Very good question. It\u2019s one of my favourite statistics. At the moment, one in five of British small businesses export. And if we could turn that from one in five to one in four, we\u2019d wipe out our trade balance altogether. So this is a big national effort required.",
        "What we have, starting at the very top, I hired the Head of HSBC to come into my government as Trade Minister. He\u2019s worked his socks off for the last two and a half years, and I\u2019m replacing him with the Head of BT, one of the most successful British companies that there is in the last few years. And Ian Livingston\u2019s going to be the new Trade Minister starting after the summer, and we have an organisation, UKTI, whose job it is to go round the country and get small businesses to export by encouraging them, by giving them the knowledge, the confidence, a bit of financial help sometimes. And we should do that.",
        "I also take trade missions all over the world. I think if you look at every G20 country, I\u2019ve taken a trade mission to every one apart from Argentina; for some reason I haven\u2019t yet made it to Argentina, but no guesses there.",
        "So I think a big national effort and, you know, we could do better at this. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any one silver bullet; I think it\u2019s really about encouraging the smaller businesses. For some of the bigger companies, I think export credits have been an issue, particularly in the difficult years of 2008\u20132010 when credit dried up, and some people say credit\u2019s still not flowing fast enough now. We have introduced some new products to help ensure people\u2019s exports, particularly in big businesses, and we\u2019ve expanded that. And we need to keep working, making sure we\u2019ve got the right products so the exporters really want to use them.",
        "I think if we do all those things, I think it\u2019s important we use all our international connections and expertise. I think Britain is fortunate in that we\u2019re in the G8, the G20, the European Union, the OECD, NATO, the Commonwealth. You know, we are in all the key networks, and we need to exploit all of our memberships of those networks to get the best for our country. And I think we\u2019ve got to look beyond Europe and recognise the fastest-growing economies in the world are going to be, you know, the Russias, the Indias, the Chinas, Malaysia, Indonesia, those countries, and we\u2019ve got to encourage businesses, yes, export to Europe, but also look further afield and build on Britain\u2019s capabilities there.",
        "Again, while we made cuts, actually, when you look at the Foreign Office and our network of embassies around the world, I\u2019ve asked them to be more efficient. I\u2019ve asked them to cut back on some of the excesses. But I\u2019ve said, \u2018Actually, we need to open more embassies, more trade missions, more posts around the world.\u2019 I think we\u2019re one of the only European countries with an embassy in every one of the ASEAN countries in Southeast Asia.",
        "So the network\u2019s there, and I hope Siemens will use it, you know. They may be our embassies, but as far as I\u2019m concerned, British businesses, British-based businesses, should use them as your home when you\u2019re exporting.",
        "**Question**",
        "I just wanted to ask about a big topic in the news at the moment, which is the involvement of our government and GCHQ in mass data collection. This is obviously a very important issue, because we use a lot more data in this day and age than we ever have before, and I just would like to ask of your views.",
        "**Prime Minister**",
        "Yes, that is a very important question. It\u2019s one of the \u2013 one of the biggest responsibilities of the Prime Minister; I am effectively the Minister for the Intelligence Services. And I think it\u2019s very important to understand what they do, to try and explain to the British public what they do and why it\u2019s so important.",
        "So I think first of all, sort of stand back and look at the threats that we face. You know, we saw what happened in America on 9/11, we saw what happened here, 7/7, we know what threats we can face. Every year since I\u2019ve been Prime Minister, our intelligence services have uncovered and prevented at least one major plot every year that could have been a mass casualty event.",
        "So we are dealing with a very serious issue: our national security. And I think it\u2019s very important that we have well funded security services \u2013 GCHQ that deals with communications, MI5, which is the domestic security service, and MI6, which deals with overseas intelligence \u2013 that we have them well funded, well organised but, crucially, within the law.",
        "There are acts of parliament that determine what they are allowed to do and what they\u2019re not allowed to do. And they\u2019re overseen by a now much strengthened, intelligence and security committee that sits in parliament, that is headed by Sir Malcolm Rifkind, a former Foreign Secretary, that can examine all the work that they do.",
        "And I\u2019m satisfied that they act within the law. And I\u2019m also satisfied, because this was important in the issues that came up, that they are not using their cooperation with foreign intelligence services to somehow get round the law; they\u2019re not using data garnered from overseas to get round the restrictions that there are in the UK. And I think that\u2019s vitally important. I mean, if you want me to say more I will.",
        "Very simply put, because I think it\u2019s quite reassuring when you hear this, if the police or intelligence service want to know the detail about a bit of communications, i.e. a mobile phone call that Mr A makes to Mr B. If they want to know simply who made the call, where were they, what was the time of the call or who were they calling, that so-called communications data, there is a legal process they have to go through to access that data. So there\u2019s a legal process. But it is very important they can access that. Think of how many murders, rapes, abductions, terrorist investigations, you know\u2026 Almost all serious crime, the police will use communications data \u2013 the, \u2018who called who, when and where?\u2019 \u2013 they\u2019ll use that data in the investigation. So it\u2019s very important they have access to that data, all done legally.",
        "That shouldn\u2019t be confused with the content of communications, i.e. what Mr A said to Mr B. Now if the intelligence services want to listen to that they have to have a signed warrant by the Home Secretary. So that\u2019s quite a high bar. So I\u2019m very satisfied, and I\u2019ve simplified it, but I\u2019m very satisfied that garnering information about the data, who called who and when, and garnering information about the content are very strictly controlled in Britain. But do I think it\u2019s important that we have security services, that they can do those things in order to keep us safe? Absolutely I do.",
        "And I see at first hand these very brave people, who never get thanked because we\u2019re not really allowed to know who they all are, working round the clock to keep us safe from very dangerous people who do us harm. So, nothing in the world is ever perfect, but I would argue we have a good system, well run, that we can be proud of in Britain, that helps to keep us safe.",
        "**Question**",
        "I\u2019m from the Siemens Commercial Academy, which takes students from sixth form straight into full-time employment and funds your degree as well. This year, sadly, we\u2019ve had to drop the degree because of the rise of university fees, which has resulted in the loss of applicants to our scheme. Are you trying to deter young people from going to university and getting a higher degree, a higher education, even given the state of, like, the unemployment in the young?",
        "**Prime Minister**",
        "That\u2019s a very good question. The answer is: no we are absolutely not trying to deter young people to go to university. And, in fact, recently the numbers of young people applying has actually been increasing rather than falling.",
        "But there is a big issue here which is how do we pay for good universities? It goes back to my argument: if we are going to be a winner in the global race, if we are going to be a success as a country, we\u2019ve got to have good universities with well paid tutors, well stocked libraries, really great technical labs. That costs money. And the only two places you can get it from: you can get it from the taxpayer \u2013 but the taxpayer has already got to pay for everything else \u2013 or you can ask students to pay. So the decision we took was to say to students that we are going to charge you more in fees for your degree. But what we said, absolutely crucially, is you pay nothing up front. There is no up-front payments, and you only start paying it back when you\u2019re earning over \u00a321,000 a year. So it\u2019s actually only better off students, only successful students that are paying back the money. You don\u2019t start paying back in full until you\u2019re earning \u00a335,000.",
        "So, look, it is a tough decision; it is difficult. But what it means is that our universities can continue to expand, our degree courses will be well funded. They\u2019ll be competitive with other countries around the world, because there\u2019s no point having second-rate degrees and second-rate universities. And I think it\u2019s fair because we\u2019re not asking people to pay back until they are earning a decent wage. But I know it is \u2013 it is difficult, but I think the evidence is beginning to show, not only, as I said, that numbers applying are looking good, but also the numbers applying from the most deprived backgrounds have increased. And that\u2019s because we\u2019ve put a lot of effort into bursaries and other packages to encourage people to go to university.",
        "But again, a lot of what I have to do is about making tough decisions that are in the long-term interest of the country. And I think this fits squarely into that. And that\u2019s what you have to do in business. Sometimes you have to make difficult decisions for the future of Siemens, for the future of manufacturing. You have to change things. You have to change processes in order to make sure your business goes on and succeeds in the future.",
        "Can I think you again very much for the warm welcome. Thank you for letting me come and see the amazing work that you do here. Can I congratulate you again on 90% of your business being exports, the massive investment you make in young people and the big investment you make in Lincoln. Thank you very much."
