        "This Government has failed to act to protect Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities since this health crisis began six months ago.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The Government\u2019s one size fits all approach just isn\u2019t working. They must introduce a Job Recovery Scheme to replace furlough, so businesses in key sectors can bring back staff on reduced hours, and publish an equality impact assessment of the financial and social measures it has taken so far to protect and support people through the pandemic.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
