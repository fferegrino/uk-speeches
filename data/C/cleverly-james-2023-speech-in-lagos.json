    "content": [
        "I\u2019m delighted to be here.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund",
        "All around us, Lagos is buzzing with activity and innovation. It\u2019s global city of entrepreneurs and free market ventures. A thriving hub of science, technology and innovation. A pulsating, captivating metropolis \u2013 attracting investment from all corners of the globe.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund",
        "What better venue could there be to share the UK\u2019s vision of our partnerships, not just with Nigeria, but with other African countries as well, a partnership we intend to endure for decades to come. The United Kingdom has long been a friend and partner of Nigeria \u2013 and other countries in Africa.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund",
        "As Foreign Secretary, I am proud of the UK\u2019s ties to this continent. They are underpinned by our shared history, the diaspora communities in the UK and in African countries \u2013 as well as the countless professional connections across academia, business, defence and development. They are continually nourished by the precious bonds of friendship.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund",
        "Now, as the UK\u2019s Foreign Secretary I\u2019m not allowed to have a favourite continent. But if I did, it would be Africa. My mother was born here. I am proud of my Sierra Leonean roots. I\u2019m also proud of the United Kingdom\u2019s contribution to the history of this great continent.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund",
        "But I\u2019m not here to talk about our shared history \u2013 fascinating a subject that it is, I am here to talk about the future. It was Ghana\u2019s first president, Dr Kwame Nkrumah, who said that his country faces neither east nor west. It faces forward.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund",
        "That is very much my outlook too. It\u2019s why I want to focus on our shared future in an era of geopolitical competition, demographic shifts, existential challenges and exciting new technologies as well.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund",
        "We are living through an era when the tectonic plates of world politics are shifting decisively. And a battle of ideas is taking place once again. This time, its focus is on the nature and the future of the international order.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund",
        "The UK\u2019s position is clear. Respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, self-determination and human rights must prevail. Alongside democracy, the rule of law, liberty and freedom.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund",
        "And I know that these are your values too. Which is why [we welcome the strong and principled stance](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-statement-on-the-situation-in-niger) that the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States have taken on the defence of democratic values and the constitutional order in Niger.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund",
        "These are all values that we cherish, and they are values of the UN Charter. Alongside self-determination, territorial integrity and an end to all laws of conquest and annexation.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "Russia\u2019s attack of Ukraine and invasion of that country, is an attack on our shared values. An attack on the UN Charter and an attack on the international order.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "But this month Russia has hit a new low. We are witnessing the grotesque spectacle of a G20 nation, deliberately burning food stocks whilst there are millions of people around the world struggling to eat.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "We live in a world of rapidly increasing transnational threats. Climate change is the most urgent and obvious example. We need strong multilateral institutions \u2013 particularly International Financial Institutions \u2013 that represent the world as it is today, economically, politically and demographically.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "This is not currently the case. The UK recognises that. And we want to work with African leaders in partnership to change it.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "We want and need a better-functioning International Financial System. We want and need permanent African representation on the UN Security Council. We want and need the African Union to become a member of the G20. Because we want and need the sheer demographic heft of African countries to be appropriately recognised in international organisations. So that we can shape the future of our world in partnership with African countries.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "Why? Because, by 2050, 2 billion people will live in Africa. Half will be under 25. Africa\u2019s share of the world\u2019s population is forecast to double from 18% to 37% by 2100. Whilst Europe\u2019s is set to shrink from 10% to just 5%.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "The shift in world power that this represents has been evident for some time. And it is my goal as Foreign Secretary to ensure that our strategic approach reflects that.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "African countries will play a pivotal role in determining the future of the international order. That is why I\u2019m here this week. To renew old friendships and to forge new ones.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "I want us to take forward a mutually beneficial agenda on trade, investment, climate action and reform of the international order. As a partner, and as a friend. Because partnership and friendship will help us reach the ambitious goals we have set ourselves.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "A prosperous, stable and secure Africa is what everyone wants, and what everybody needs. It\u2019s good for the 1.5 billion people who live on this great continent. It\u2019s also good for the UK. And it\u2019s good for the world.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "Our approach in Africa will continue to be driven by the needs and perspectives of our partners across the continent. Be it development, security, sustainability or green and clean infrastructure, we are working shoulder to shoulder with our African partners \u2013 and we will continue to do so.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "Of course \u2013 there are many unknowns. We do not know when the next pandemic will strike. We cannot predict exactly when Ukraine will defeat this Russia\u2019s invasion. We don\u2019t know how the situation in Sudan or Niger will evolve. We have limited control over the pace of geopolitical change. And we cannot predict, with any great precision, the ultimate effects of climate change.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "But what we do have is the power to set direction and plan strategically, laying the foundations of resilience whilst working towards our mutual prosperity and security.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "That\u2019s why partnership is so important. And it\u2019s why we will continue to support African countries through urgent crises via our bilateral programmes, as we work in concert with organisations like the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States to enhance stability and security.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "It\u2019s why we continue to support the African Continental Free Trade Area. Because by strengthening stability and security, we will improve lives in Africa and the UK simultaneously.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "But let me come back to our venue here today. Lagos represents Africa\u2019s ever-growing confidence, it\u2019s ever-growing economic strength and the immense future potential.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "Through trade, investment and the combined force of public investment and private capital, the UK wants to partner with you in reaching your full economic potential. Because when African countries are prosperous and stable, the UK benefits.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "The UK has been one of the biggest international investors in Africa. According to The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, British companies collectively hold the largest stock of Foreign Direct Investment in African countries. Total trade in goods and services between the UK and Africa reached \u00a344.7 billion in 2022 \u2013 an increase of 32.5% on the previous year.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "This is already an excellent foundation on which to build. But in the future, I want to do even more.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "Over half of British International Investment\u2019s portfolio is in Africa. It committed nearly \u00a3700 million of investment in 2022 alone, and is set to become one of the largest climate investors in Africa by 2026.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "UK Export Finance has provided more than \u00a33.5 billion for projects in Africa since 2020. And the City of London offers high-quality finance, investment opportunities and support in creating the right regulations for sustainable growth.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "In 2021 and 2022, African issuers raised \u00a313 billion on the London Stock Exchange.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "Here in Nigeria, the UK\u2019s Manufacturing Africa programme is supporting 22 manufacturing deals, worth $664 million, spanning electric vehicles, solar energy waste recycling \u2013 and much more. We strongly welcome President Tinubu\u2019s economic reforms, including the removal of fuel subsidies and the unifying of exchange rates.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "And I was delighted to see that Ghana has adopted an ambitious economic reform programme to secure approval of their IMF programme. These decisions will encourage economic investment, and will help drive growth, and jobs.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "But sound macro-economic reforms at national level, no matter how inventive and bold, can only go so far. African countries need capital to drive investment, development and jobs.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "That\u2019s why it\u2019s imperative that International Financial Institutions accommodate our shared aspiration for a bigger, more responsive and fairer system. If multilateral development banks implement the recommendations of the G20\u2019s independent Capital Adequacy Framework review, they will unlock hundreds of billions of dollars in development finance.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "The UK is taking a leading role on reform of International Financial Institutions. And we\u2019re investing in the World Bank and the African Development Bank \u2013 which of course is majority African owned \u2013 so that they can finance infrastructure and support trade right across Africa.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "We support the aims of the Bridgetown Agenda. And I\u2019m working with our partners to ensure that our aspiration is converted into action. It\u2019s why we support the \u2018Room to Run\u2019 guarantee to the African Development Bank, which is expected to unlock up to $2 billion worth of new financing for projects across the continent.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "But the public sector alone cannot provide all the investment that is needed. Private capital is essential.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "That\u2019s why the UK government is promoting private sector investment in Nigeria, and across the continent. And we will do our utmost to galvanise even more interest. I\u2019ll come back to that in just a second.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "We will also continue to champion further multilateral reforms that will benefit Africa. Like the better and faster implementation of international tax rules that will stop revenues leaking from your national treasury. Or international rules for the governance of Artificial Intelligence and transformational technologies.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "Reform of international rules is not in the UK\u2019s gift alone \u2013 no one country can bring about multilateral reform. But change is possible when we work in partnership on reforms that benefit not just African countries or the UK \u2013 but the whole world.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "A sustainable international order is in all our interests. It will make us safer. And it will drive future prosperity. Higher growth will bring more and better jobs as well as the revenue you need to update infrastructure and provide public services for all Nigerians.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations",
        "Whilst I\u2019m on the subject of growth, let me say how strongly I believe that the inclusion of women is critical to all our economies. If women participated in labour markets on an equal footing with men, this could add $28 trillion, or 26%, to global GDP in 2025.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Failure to take advantage of that statistic is wasteful beyond belief. That\u2019s why British International Investment will ensure that at least 25% of their new investments focus on empowering women and girls\u2019 and their economic development.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "And if we\u2019re talking about future economic growth and our shared prosperity agenda, I have to say a word of praise for Nigeria. Your track record on tech is exceptional \u2013 indeed you received 44% of all international tech investment into Africa in 2021.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "And the UK is proud to be playing even a small part in your success. Our Digital Access Programme promotes connectivity and digital skills in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "This in turn stimulates innovation and sparks global development. And I\u2019m also proud to announce a new \u00a310 million partnership with Infacredit, which shares the risk in financing new infrastructure projects, and by doing so, leverages much more domestic private capital. That\u2019s a great way of financing economic development, and we\u2019re working to set up similar facilities in other African countries.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "But a real uplift in growth and prosperity cannot come without an increase in international trade. That\u2019s why our [Developing Countries Trading Scheme (DCTS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/trading-with-developing-nations) will extend tariff cuts to hundreds of more products exported from developing countries in Africa and elsewhere. This means that 98% of goods imported from Africa into the UK will enter duty free and new rules of origin will help the least developed economies integrate into global supply chains.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Increased trade stimulates partnerships. And our collective power today \u2013 the power of African countries and the UK together \u2013 is founded on the quality and number of our partnerships. Only together can we adequately address shared challenges. Only together can we harness opportunities, and only together can we improve living standards.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "That\u2019s why in April next year, we will be hosting the [UK-African Investment Summit](https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/uk-african-investment-summit-2024) in London. This will be a milestone event and a further sign of the way we are stepping up our engagement and partnership with African countries.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Our summit recognises the immense potential and opportunities for innovation across this continent for governments, businesses and for investors. And we want the summit\u2019s outcome to be a new consensus across governments and the private sector that together we can deliver on inclusive growth, jobs, food security and the green economic transition.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "But you cannot have prosperity without security. Strengthening peace and security in Africa is therefore critical to unlocking our full joint potential.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "And it is also critical that we include women in peace processes so that they deliver better and longer lasting outcomes. Development gains and a fragile peace can be easily lost if large parts of a population are marginalised, or human rights are not respected.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "We will continue to focus on strengthening African countries\u2019 resilience against threats, as well as addressing the drivers of conflict and instability. Strategic security and defence partnerships \u2013 like those we have with Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya \u2013 are a powerful means of achieving this goal.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "We support African countries in their ongoing fight to counter-terrorism. African leadership, with support from the UK and others, has eliminated piracy off the coast of Somalia \u2013 and dramatically curtailed piracy off the Gulf of Guinea. As a result, the whole world has benefited.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "But security and prosperity rely on scientific innovation. The UK government recognises the need for investment in science and technology. That\u2019s why we plan to expand our science and technology partnerships. Building on the success of our Digital Access Programme, which promotes connectivity and digital skills in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "And we will work with our partners to commercialise scientific knowledge. Public-private partnerships and an open approach to science make the spread of innovation easier and the work of pioneers more accessible.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Our spirit of partnership provides opportunities to collaborate and accelerates progress towards our shared objectives. I say again: when you benefit, we benefit. We are proud that there are already many strong examples of partnerships with the UK across this continent.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "My ambition is not just to emulate but to surpass those achievements. And to face our shared future with optimism. Let there be no doubt. When it comes to our partnerships, the best is yet to come.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Thank you.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
