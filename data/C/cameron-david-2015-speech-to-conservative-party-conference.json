        "I am so proud to be standing here in front of you today \u2013 back in government\u2026",
        "\u2026and not just any government \u2013 a majority Conservative Government.",
        "To the people in this hall, I want to say thank you.",
        "You are the greatest team a Prime Minister could ever have.",
        "And to the British people:",
        "When you put your cross in the Conservative box, you were putting your faith in us.",
        "To finish the job we started. To back working people. To deliver security for you and your family.",
        "And I\u2019ll tell you now: we will not let you down.",
        "But just for a moment, think back to May 7th.",
        "I don\u2019t know about you, but it only takes two words to make me smile. Exit poll.",
        "And then what happened that night:",
        "The Conservatives, winning across Wales; on the march in the Midlands.",
        "Bolton West, Derby North, Berwick, Wells \u2013 Conservative once more\u2026",
        "\u2026Gower for the first time ever.",
        "The North, more Tory; the South, the East, almost a clean sweep\u2026",
        "\u2026and Cornwall \u2013 that wonderful county \u2013 100 per cent Conservative.",
        "As dawn rose, a new light \u2013 a bluer light \u2013 fell across our isles.",
        "And I will never forget that morning. Getting back to London. Seeing many of you. Then sitting down in the flat at No10 with Sam and the kids getting ready for school.",
        "There we were, surrounded by half-packed boxes and bin bags. Well, you have to be ready for anything.",
        "I was writing my speech and preparing to go and see Her Majesty. And I thought\u2026 I\u2019ll just lie down and let it all sink in.",
        "As I shut my eyes, Ed Balls had gone. And when I woke up and I switched on the radio, Nigel Farage had gone too.",
        "There was a brief moment when I thought it was all a dream.",
        "But there\u2019s a serious point.",
        "Why did all the pollsters and the pundits get it so wrong?",
        "Because, fundamentally, they didn\u2019t understand the people who make up our country.",
        "The vast majority of people aren\u2019t obsessives, arguing at the extremes of the debate.",
        "Let me put it as simply as I can: Britain and Twitter are not the same thing.",
        "The British people are decent, sensible, reasonable\u2026",
        "\u2026and they just want a government that supports the vulnerable, backs those who do the right thing and helps them get on in life.",
        "Good jobs; a decent home; better childcare; controlled immigration; lower taxes so there\u2019s more money at the end of the month\u2026",
        "\u2026an NHS that\u2019s there for them, 7 days a week; great schools; dignity in retirement\u2026",
        "\u2026that is what people want and that is what we will deliver.",
        "The party of working people, the party for working people \u2013 today, tomorrow, always.",
        "**PARTY CHANGE**",
        "Ten years ago, I stood on a stage just like this one and said if we changed our party we could change our country.",
        "We\u2019ve done that \u2013 together.",
        "I didn\u2019t campaign on the NHS alone \u2013 you joined me.",
        "It wasn\u2019t just me who put social justice, equality for gay people, tackling climate change, and helping the world\u2019s poorest at the centre of the Conservative Party\u2019s mission \u2013 we all did.",
        "And I didn\u2019t select our candidates \u2013 it was you.",
        "Look who was elected in May.",
        "Nusrat Ghani, whose parents, just a generation ago, were living in a small village in Kashmir.",
        "Seema Kennedy, who was five when she and her family were forced to flee revolutionary Iran.",
        "Five years ago, Johnny Mercer was on his third tour of duty in Afghanistan. Caught in an ambush, he was left cradling a dear comrade as he lay fatally wounded.",
        "Just days before the election, Scott Mann was doing his postal round in Cornwall \u2013 delivering not just his own campaign leaflets, but his rivals\u2019 too.",
        "Different journeys, often difficult journeys, all leading here.",
        "So let us hear it for them now \u2013 the new generation of Conservative MPs.",
        "Round the cabinet table, a third of my colleagues are women.",
        "A few months ago, we were discussing childcare.",
        "It was introduced by the Black British son of a single parent, Sam Gyimah.",
        "He was backed up by the daughter of Gujarati immigrants who arrived in our country from East Africa with nothing except the clothes they stood up in, Priti Patel\u2026",
        "\u2026and the first speaker was Sajid Javid, whose father came here from Pakistan to drive the buses.",
        "This is what we\u2019ve done together.",
        "And now with couples married because of us\u2026",
        "\u2026working people backed because of us\u2026",
        "\u2026the NHS safe because of us\u2026",
        "\u2026and children in the poorest parts of the world saved because of us\u2026",
        "\u2026everyone in this hall can be incredibly proud of our journey \u2013 the journey of the modern, compassionate, One Nation Conservative Party.",
        "**GREATER BRITAIN**",
        "So as five years of government stretch out before us, what do I see on the skyline?",
        "I love Britain. I love our history and what we\u2019ve given to the world.",
        "I love our get-up-and-go; that whenever we\u2019re down, we\u2019re never out.",
        "I love our character; our decency; our sense of humour.",
        "I love every part of our country. England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland \u2013 we are one nation and I will defend our Union with everything I have got.",
        "Every day, in every way, Great Britain lives up to its name.",
        "And I know this: we can make it greater still.",
        "A Greater Britain. Where people have greater hope, greater chances, greater security.",
        "I really believe we\u2019re on the brink of something special in our country.",
        "This year, we\u2019ve seen more people in work than at any time in our history\u2026",
        "\u2026more of our children starting university than ever before\u2026",
        "\u2026more British entrepreneurs setting up shop than anywhere else in Europe.",
        "Wages are rising. Hope is returning. We\u2019re moving into the light.",
        "But we\u2019re not there yet.",
        "We\u2019re only half way through.",
        "For me, that has a very literal meaning.",
        "I can say something today that perhaps no Prime Minister has ever really been able to say before.",
        "I\u2019m starting the second half of my time in this job.",
        "As you know, I am not going to fight another election as your leader. So I don\u2019t have the luxury of unlimited time.",
        "Let me tell you: I am in just as much of a hurry as five years ago.",
        "Securing our country, growing our economy; jobs, exports, growth, infrastructure\u2026",
        "\u2026these are the stepping stones on the path to greatness for our country \u2013 and we\u2019ve been laying them every day since we came to office.",
        "We will continue to do so.",
        "But to make Britain greater, we need to tackle some deep social problems\u2026",
        "\u2026problems we only just made a start on, as we focused on the economic emergency that faced us.",
        "The scourge of poverty.",
        "The brick wall of blocked opportunity.",
        "The shadow of extremism \u2013 hanging over every single one of us.",
        "A Greater Britain doesn\u2019t just need a stronger economy \u2013 it needs a stronger society.",
        "And delivering this social reform is entirely fitting with the great history of the Conservative Party\u2026",
        "\u2026who have always been the optimists, the agents of hope and the leaders of change.",
        "That\u2019s why I joined it.",
        "That\u2019s why I wanted to lead it.",
        "And now, in my final term as Prime Minister, I say: let\u2019s live up to the greatest traditions of Conservative social reform.",
        "**CONSERVATIVE VALUES**",
        "In all the challenges we face, we will be guided by our Conservative values.",
        "Our belief in strong defence and sound money.",
        "Our belief in an enterprise economy\u2026",
        "\u2026that if you set free the ambition that burns so deeply within the British people, they will strike out on their own, take on new workers, take on the world.",
        "Our belief in equality of opportunity, as opposed to equality of outcome\u2026",
        "\u2026not everyone ending up with the same exam results, the same salary, the same house \u2013 but everyone having the same shot at them.",
        "Now some people may argue these things are obvious.",
        "I have to tell you, they\u2019re not.",
        "It becomes clearer by the day that the Labour Party has completely abandoned any notion of these ideas.",
        "So let us resolve here, at this conference, to do what we\u2019ve always done: to prove our Conservative truths\u2026",
        "\u2026to save Britain from the danger of Labour\u2026",
        "\u2026and to rebuild Britain so it is greater still.",
        "A Greater Britain \u2013 that is our goal.",
        "**NATIONAL SECURITY**",
        "It begins by making the case for strong defence.",
        "My first duty as Prime Minister is to keep people safe.",
        "Some of the loneliest moments in this job are when you are reading intelligence reports about plots being planned against the British people.",
        "This summer I was told that Reyaad Khan and Junaid Hussain were in Syria planning terrorist attacks on UK soil.",
        "Of course, I asked all the proper questions.",
        "How do we stop them? Is there another way? Do we have that capability? Is it legal?",
        "I knew that whatever action I took would provoke a big debate.",
        "But my job as Prime Minister is quite simple, really: ultimately, it\u2019s not to debate; it\u2019s to decide.",
        "And the choice I faced was this:",
        "Act \u2013 and we could stop them carrying out their plans.",
        "Stall \u2013 and we could see innocent people murdered on our streets.",
        "So I took decisive action to keep Britain safe \u2013 and that\u2019s what I will always do.",
        "****",
        "**LABOUR LEADER**",
        "And on the subject of protecting our country from terrorism, let me just say this:",
        "Thousands of words have been written about the new Labour leader.",
        "But you only really need to know one thing: he thinks the death of Osama bin Laden was a \u201ctragedy\u201d.",
        "No.",
        "A tragedy is nearly 3,000 people murdered one morning in New York.",
        "A tragedy is the mums and dads who never came home from work that day.",
        "A tragedy is people jumping from the towers after the planes hit.",
        "My friends \u2013 we cannot let that man inflict his security-threatening, terrorist-sympathising, Britain-hating ideology on the country we love.",
        "**MIGRATION**",
        "Another big judgement call to make is when a refugee crisis confronts our world.",
        "Like most people, I found it impossible to get the image of that poor Syrian boy Aylan Kurdi out of my mind.",
        "We know in our hearts our responsibilities to help those fleeing for their lives.",
        "But we know, too, that we must keep our heads.",
        "Let\u2019s start with a simple fact.",
        "Twelve million people have been made homeless by the conflict in Syria. And so far only 4 per cent of them have come to Europe.",
        "If we opened the door to every refugee, our country would be overwhelmed.",
        "The best thing Britain can do is help neighbouring countries, the Syrian people and the refugees in the camps \u2026",
        "\u2026and when we do take refugees, to take them from the region, rather than acting in a way that encourages more to make that dangerous journey.",
        "As we do this, let\u2019s remember: we haven\u2019t only just started caring about Syrians.",
        "We\u2019ve been helping them over the past four years, giving more in aid to that part of the world than any other country except America.",
        "And we have been able to do that because this party made a promise and kept a promise \u2013 to spend 0.7 per cent of our national income on aid.",
        "Other countries also made that promise. But they didn\u2019t keep it.",
        "I say to them: if Britain can keep her promises, so should you.",
        "But the real answer to the refugee crisis lies in helping countries like Syria become places where people actually want to live.",
        "That means having a government that\u2019s not terrorising its people \u2013 and that\u2019s why Assad must go.",
        "In its place, we need a government that can be our ally in the defeat of ISIL\u2026",
        "\u2026because we will never be safe here in Britain until we eradicate that death cult.",
        "Some think we can contract that out to America. We shouldn\u2019t. We must play our part too.",
        "And we can, because of that commitment we made this summer: yes, we will spend two per cent of our GDP on defence \u2013 this year, next year, throughout this decade.",
        "In the coming years, we\u2019ll be launching the biggest aircraft carriers in our history\u2026",
        "\u2026a new class of Hunter Killer submarines\u2026",
        "\u2026new Joint Strike Fighter jets; improved Apache helicopters; a new fleet of drones\u2026",
        "\u2026and because our independent nuclear deterrent is our ultimate insurance policy \u2013 this Government will order four new trident submarines.",
        "In government, I have a team who keep us safe at home and abroad\u2026",
        "\u2026Justine Greening, Michael Fallon, Philip Hammond and Theresa May.",
        "But above all, we have Britain\u2019s Armed Forces.",
        "Let me tell you this:",
        "In the last year alone they tackled Ebola in West Africa; protected the skies over the Baltic; flew missions over Iraq.",
        "They built defences against ISIL in Lebanon; trained army officers in Afghanistan; and patrolled the seas around the Falklands.",
        "There they were, in the Pacific, flying supplies to cyclone victims; in the Atlantic, shipping assistance to those hit by hurricanes; in the Med, pulling people out of sinking dinghies.",
        "Little England? No. Never.",
        "Great Britain. And I\u2019ll tell you what, with Armed Forces like this, we can be even greater still.",
        "So let\u2019s stand and thank them for everything they do to keep us safe.",
        "**EUROPE**",
        "A Greater Britain is one that is strong in the world \u2013 and that should mean one that is strong in Europe, too.",
        "It comes back to those Conservative values: our belief in the nation state, but also in free trade.",
        "We all know what\u2019s wrong with the EU \u2013 it\u2019s got too big, too bossy, too interfering.",
        "But we also know what\u2019s right about it \u2013 it\u2019s the biggest single market in the world.",
        "Now, some people say: \u201ctake what we\u2019ve got and put up with it\u201d.",
        "Others say: \u201cjust walk away from the whole thing\u201d.",
        "I say: no. This is Britain. We don\u2019t duck fights. We get stuck in. We fix problems.",
        "That\u2019s how we kept our border checkpoints when others decided to take theirs down.",
        "It\u2019s how we kept the pound when others went head first into the Euro.",
        "Because we do things our way.",
        "We get rebates. We get out of bailouts.",
        "But do you know what? It\u2019s not just what we get out of, it\u2019s what we get Europe into.",
        "Who do you think got Europe to open trade talks with America, which would be the biggest trade deal in our history?",
        "Who do you think got Europe to agree to sanctions on Iran, which brought that country to the negotiating table?",
        "Us. Britain. We did.",
        "Believe me, I have no romantic attachment to the European Union and its institutions.",
        "I\u2019m only interested in two things: Britain\u2019s prosperity and Britain\u2019s influence.",
        "That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to fight hard in this renegotiation \u2013 so we can get a better deal and the best of both worlds.",
        "Let me give you one example.",
        "When we joined the European Union we were told that it was about going into a common market, rather than the goal that some had for \u201cever closer union\u201d.",
        "Let me put this very clearly: Britain is not interested in \u201cever closer union\u201d \u2013 and I will put that right.",
        "****",
        "**ECONOMIC SECURITY**",
        "A Greater Britain needs a dynamic economy.",
        "Today, it\u2019s a beacon in an uncertain world\u2026",
        "\u2026we\u2019ve got more foreign investment flooding into our country than anywhere else in Europe \u2013 anywhere in the world except for America and China.",
        "But if anyone thinks the battle on the economy is won, they need to think again. The battle has only just begun.",
        "We still need to find savings and produce more; still need to become more competitive; still need to make the most of our entire country \u2013 and build the Northern Powerhouse.",
        "And all at a time when our opponents have given up any sensible, reasonable, rational arguments on the economy.",
        "We live in a country where the main opposition party \u2013 let\u2019s not forget, the alternative government \u2013 believes in nationalising industries without compensation, jacking up taxes to 60 per cent of people\u2019s income, and printing money.",
        "There\u2019s an academic called Richard Murphy. He\u2019s the Labour Party\u2019s new economics guru, and the man behind their plan to print more money.",
        "He gave an interview a few weeks ago. He was very frank. He admitted that Labour\u2019s plan would cause a \u201csterling crisis\u201d, but to be fair\u2026",
        "\u2026he did add, and I quote, that it \u201cwould pass very quickly\u201d.",
        "Well, that\u2019s alright then.",
        "His book is actually called \u201cThe Joy of Tax\u201d. I\u2019ve read it. It\u2019s got 64 positions \u2013 and they\u2019re all wrong.",
        "This is actually serious.",
        "I tell you: our party\u2019s success in growing our economy and winning the economic arguments has never been more vital.",
        "Nothing less than the security of every single family in our country depends on it.",
        "And as we do that, I know that we will have on our side not just the British people, not just British business\u2026",
        "\u2026but our Iron Chancellor, George Osborne.",
        "You know what makes me most angry about Labour?",
        "It\u2019s not just that their arguments are wrong; it\u2019s the self-righteous way they make them.",
        "The deficit-deniers, who go around saying we\u2019re hurting the poor.",
        "Hang on a second.",
        "Who gets hurt when governments lose control of spending and interest rates go through the roof?",
        "Who gets hurt when you waste money on debt interest and have to cut the NHS?",
        "Who gets hurt when taxes go up and businesses start firing rather than hiring?",
        "No \u2013 not the rich\u2026",
        "\u2026it\u2019s poor people, working people.",
        "Yes, the very people Labour claim to be for.",
        "Well let\u2019s just remember: Labour ideas don\u2019t help the poor, they hurt the poor.",
        "That\u2019s right, Labour: you\u2019re not for working people, but hurting people.",
        "If you want a lecture about poverty, ask Labour.",
        "If you want something done about it, come to us, the Conservatives.",
        "There\u2019s another argument we need to win.",
        "There are some people who understand the deficit needs to come down, but don\u2019t get why we need a surplus.",
        "I\u2019ll tell you why.",
        "I don\u2019t stand here like a former Prime Minister once did and say I have abolished boom and bust.",
        "We can\u2019t just be thinking about today, we should be thinking about the rainy days that could come \u2013 just like a family does.",
        "They put something aside, take out the insurance plan, pay off some of the mortgage when they have something spare.",
        "That\u2019s what we should do as a country \u2013 making sure we are ready to cope with future crises.",
        "There\u2019s a word for those who say live for today, forget about tomorrow: it\u2019s selfish.",
        "I\u2019m not here to mortgage our children\u2019s future. I\u2019m here to insure it.",
        "**HOME OWNERSHIP**",
        "But for me, there\u2019s one big piece of unfinished business in our economy: housing.",
        "A Greater Britain must mean more families owning a home of their own.",
        "It goes back to those Conservative beliefs: reward for hard work.",
        "If you\u2019ve worked hard and saved, I don\u2019t want you just to have a roof over your head \u2013 I want you to have a roof of your own.",
        "In the last 5 years, 600,000 new homes have been built.",
