        "It is a great pleasure to be to here with you today making my first public outing outside of Parliament since returning to Defra.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "I\u2019ve always found the CLA to be a sensible voice at local and national level, and it\u2019s had the great judgement to hiring Sarah Hendry as your director general, who was one of my best civil servants I ever worked with, during my first time at Defra when I spent 3 years there. It\u2019s good to be back.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The CLA have been at the forefront of thinking imaginatively, ambitiously, and practically about the future of farming for well over a hundred years now never mind since the British people voted to leave the European Union. You\u2019re right Mark to reference your Rural Powerhouse Report. And it\u2019s important that we continue to use documents like that with potential policy ideas and long may it continue.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "I thought it might be worth turning straight away to some of the comments made by Mark Tufnell and Professor Sally Shortall now. Some may not know this, when I was first in the role at Defra as Environment Minister, I asked to do more about rural life, and so I actually created the extra bit of rural life opportunities, and it is important that we have that focus in our department. Lord Benyon is our Rural Affairs Minister but I can assure that we all represent rural areas, we\u2019re very conscious of the points that you\u2019ve laid out. In Cumbria I think is the situation with the 16 plus bought instead of the daily trips to and from the college, recognising the opportunities to have. And indeed, some of the work I did at DWP, when we were in the framing of the levelling up framework that Michael Gove of course, pioneered, former Defra Secretary of State, and is leading once again in Government. One of the things I pointed out to my colleagues is that quite often you see a map of where people are considered to have really low income, and are not very well off and not particularly productive, and it really surprised them to hear that the district council areas with lowest median salary, were all rural, including the Prime Ministers own constituency, his council, was the third lowest median salary in the country. And that recognises quite a lot of the fact that the predominant sectors there are agricultural and tourism. And if you\u2019re working in there rather than perhaps being the owner of one of the enterprises then the salaries are not as high as we\u2019d like I\u2019m sure.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "I want to stress that I will be having this important focus, and I know that all our Ministers are similarly engaged, recognising that we want to make sure that the prism of rural life is reflected and considered, particularly in things like levelling up, and the shared prosperity fund as we move forward.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Turning to what Mark said, as he\u2019s pointed out, overcoming barriers to business success is the main theme of this conference today, and while most of my comments will be about the farming side of your members interests, I think it\u2019s a reflection that it\u2019s absolutely critical that we get growth going again in this country and I do see the rural economy as a part of that. And I like to think that what we have done in the last 12 years, it may not be all complete I get that, but extending internet and broadband access that\u2019s largely done; we still need to improve the mobile phone connection; I know that for farmers they welcome the fact that we\u2019re adjusting taxes so that we can spread over 5 years instead of the annual tax return. And I thought that would be useful towards the cash flow challenges that sometimes come, as we see different outcomes every season.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "But indeed also, we have rightly kept the inheritance tax exemption under agricultural. But I think we\u2019ve also tried to strive to help businesses find more sector diversify. I know that we\u2019ve already changed planning rules and guidance to allow more use of our buildings, and I do want to point out that primarily it is the local government and local councils that make decisions on individual local planning applications, and to some extent the national planning policy framework will of course help guide that, but it is their decision on exactly where and how through their local plans they support the rural economy to thrive.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "And as I say, Lord Benyon is the rural affairs Minister, and I can assure you my time in 12 years as being a member if Parliament for Suffolk coastal where I\u2019ve seen Grade 4 land \u2013 I\u2019m not quite sure if Grade 5 land has been used \u2013 but Grade 4 land is used for very productive production of much of the food that gets eaten in this country, and indeed extending the seasons to get through crops of potatoes every year I think is particularly special. I continue to learn and I do see the CLA, pretty much every year at the Suffolk Show, and I\u2019m very delighted to go and meet them as well as other my constituents.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Now turning to the more broad substance, I know that there are many pressures that are coalescing right now that impact your businesses, whether that\u2019s flooding and droughts that we\u2019ve seen, outbreaks of pests and diseases, or indeed the global challenges affecting prices, energy and supply chains and we should be very clear the aftershock of covid I\u2019m afraid will still be with us for some time and I cannot give you any timeline exactly on how long the illegal invasion of Ukraine will carry on but we know there will be consequences and there are consequences right now and that\u2019s why the Government is making changes to its energy strategy to try and mitigate.. Those things will not come straight away apart from some of the support schemes that are already in place.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "But it is why we have set out urgent new measures and change on how we\u2019ve dealt with avian influenza.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "It\u2019s why we hope that the support we\u2019re trying to give to farmers, recognising the rising input costs for feed and energy through a range of measures, whether that\u2019s continuing the mini budget last year reinstated, the fuel duty and VAT cuts, and in terms of action to reduce business rates and indeed the businesses energy support scheme.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "So, knowing cashflow is probably the critical thing that we will help an enterprise keep going or not, it\u2019s why to support farmers\u2019 cashflows we changed BPS payment to twice a year, for the first time ever, and that\u2019s only thanks to leaving the EU that we\u2019ve been able to make those changes.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "We paid out \u00a3677 million out to you earlier this year. And a further \u00a3620 million will be paid from today. And I want to assure you that the Farming Minister, Mark Spencer, is meeting retailers and processors regularly, to encourage them to recognise that the burden of higher input costs is falling heavily on farmers.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Thinking of these global impacts, I don\u2019t think anywhere in the world has felt these more keenly than in Ukraine, traditionally the breadbasket of Europe.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Amidst the turmoil of war, it is truly extraordinary that the farmers of Ukraine have managed to get so much of the harvest in. And at time when Ukrainians themselves are suffering so much I was really pleased that we were able to support this initiative to get grain from Ukraine to some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world. And I genuinely think that what they\u2019ve done is an act of global humanity at its very best.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "That\u2019s why at the weekend I was proud to join the conference and to send a contribution of \u00a35m to Ukraine to support this initiative on behalf of the Government, the British people, and indeed particularly on behalf of farmers.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Now I\u2019m less than 2 months into the role, there is still a lot that I\u2019m still working through at Defra. And while having spent 3 years in the department before I\u2019m now the Secretary of State and have a much wider range of issues to tackle.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "But I felt it was important for me to be clear about our intentions for the future. So, I\u2019ll cut to the chase.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "As we made clear in our manifesto, one of the biggest bonuses of leaving the EU, was the opportunity to free our farmers from the bureaucratic Common Agricultural Policy and move to a system as we set out in our manifesto based on spending public money in a way that helps us to secure the public good.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "I like to think we have already started cutting back the red tape that has held you and us back, scrapping the three-crop rule and greening requirements that really did so little for nature, because that actually caused real headaches for you without really much outcome.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "We certainly have guaranteed the annual farming budget over this Parliament but in return we want to support you to farm in a way that safeguards high standards of animal welfare and protects and enhances our natural environment. So we make timely progress towards meeting our vital targets to halt the decline of nature in our country during this decade and ultimately to reach net zero by 2050 \u2013 making progress with every carbon budget, securing the clean and plentiful water that we need to build the resilience of our businesses, our food system, and our whole country to the impacts of a changing climate, so that we can secure the strong foundation of our whole economy \u2013 and the engine of our rural economy as well.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Farming is the backbone of our second largest manufacturing sector, it bring jobs to every county, and does play a vital role in rural communities across our country.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "That is why we decided, in good faith, to review our plans, to make sure that we achieve the greatest possible impact for our environment, that we would secure the biggest bang for our buck in the way we spend tax payer\u2019s money, and so that it is easy and attractive for farmers get involved.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "I know you need certainty, you need to plan ahead for future investment cycles. But I also want to be clear we recognise the needs that we may need to be agile and retain the dynamism that we have set in motion so we make sure that we are funding schemes that work in terms of the outcomes and in terms of take up.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "That is why we will continue to work together to iterate and improve our approach over time.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "And I think back to when I was in the role before and I was told how HLS was the best designed scheme in Europe, and the problem was hardly anyone took it up, and that\u2019s something we really need to avoid.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "So turning to the next steps, where decades, even generations of hard-won experience have given us a strong sense of what already works. I\u2019m very clear we don\u2019t need to reinvent the wheel.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "It\u2019s important that we support your stewardship of our shared stock of natural capital across our brilliant landscapes and reflect the immense contribution you make to your communities and also respect the way of life that you cherish.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "I am pleased to tell you that the review is now complete and that we are moving ahead with the transition, on the same timescale and with three schemes.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "All the funding that we are taking out through reductions in BPS over time will continue to be made available to farmers through a combination of one-off grants and ongoing schemes and the advice you need to get your business on the right footing for the future.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "As we make those planned, steady reductions to BPS payments, we will offer payment to you to take action through our three environmental land management schemes.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "And our aim, across those schemes, is not \u2018one size fits all\u2019 but a range of options so everyone can find a combination that works for them.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "So whether you\u2019re a commoner, upland farmer, or small family farm, and whether you\u2019re a landowner or a tenant farmer recognising elements of the Rock review.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "As your president said, the choice is not producing food or doing environmental schemes, it\u2019s about making space for nature and that must go alongside sustainable food production.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "They are not mutually exclusive. They can be symbiotic.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "And we need to embrace the complexity that holds the key to getting the critical decisions right on how we can make the most of our land to achieve all the things we want to do from planting forests and protecting peatlands to producing food.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "We can bolster sustainable, resilient food production and protect our shared natural heritage and our rural heritage. We need to build more of the homes that people need while we also get on with tackling the causes and the impacts of climate change as well as improving the state of nature.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "And we will have those honest conversations with you about how we maximise those multiple benefits for land.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "So, turning to our three schemes.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "As we reduce the amount being spent on BPS we will be adding options to our current offer so that by 2024, farmers will have access to the full range of actions they can be paid to take on their land.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "For our Sustainable Farming Incentive \u2013 our aim is to get as many of you as possible signed up.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The initial phase is now live \u2013 and is focused specifically on securing the health of our soil that is critical to food production and to reducing inputs so that we support the natural world from the ground up.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "I\u2019m really pleased that over 30,000 farmers are now involved in our simplified, streamlined, and I hope overall, enhanced Countryside Stewardship scheme \u2013 that\u2019s a 94% increase in three years. Something must be working.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "We have listened to your concerns, we\u2019ve learned from your experiences and I hope we\u2019ve made a lot of improvements \u2013 but we know there\u2019s a lot more to do.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "I want to build on that success, by developing Countryside Stewardship, so we achieve the same ambitious outcomes that we intended to deliver through Local Nature Recovery but instead to have an enhanced version of the Countryside Stewardship scheme that is already part of thousands of farm businesses rather than introducing a whole new process.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "That is the right thing to do and the smart thing to do with public money as we develop the markets that will draw in finance from all sources.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "And it seems to me to be common sense that when communities come together locally or businesses come together to create the sort of wildlife corridors that are critical to the connectivity as well as the diversity and abundance of species and to the health of our waterways, the impact that they achieve together will be greater than the sum of its parts and as a consequence you will be rewarded accordingly.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
