    "content": [
        "When Mr Blair was first elected he told us that education was his \u2018number one priority\u2019 . The following year he said \u2018there is no greater injustice to inflict upon a child than a poor education\u2019 . But after eight years, four Education Secretaries and now three manifestos, all we have had is more talk, while across the country thousands of children are being failed by just such a poor education.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The ability to read and write is at the foundation of all learning. Without those basic skills, the whole field of education is a closed door. But for too many pupils, that door has remained firmly shut.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "One in three pupils leave primary school unable to write properly, and 44,000 leave secondary school without a single GCSE. Employers complain that many school leavers lack basic literacy and numeracy, meaning they have to invest in remedial training to bring them up to scratch. . As Digby Jones of the CBI puts it, employers \u2018pick up the pieces and the bill\u2019 for the failures in our education system .\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Even Mr Blair himself, in a rare moment of candour, has admitted the number of pupils unable to meet basic standards is a \u2018scandal\u2019 .\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "And who is worst hit? Evidence shows it is the most underprivileged who suffer most. Children from underachieving, underprivileged backgrounds. Children whose parents do not or cannot teach them the basics themselves, and, as Michael has said, children of immigrants whose first language is not English.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "When one in five children \u2013 and arguably one in three \u2013 do not achieve the standard of reading and writing expected of their age, it is clear the current approach isn\u2019t working. The Labour-dominated Education Select Committee last week called this figure \u2018unacceptably high\u2019, and I wholeheartedly agree with them.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Mr Blair said in his manifesto yesterday that \u2018we want to see every pupil achieving the basics\u2019 \u2013 but we have heard it all before. After eight years, the number of children failed by his policies on literacy stands at over a million .\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "We need more than just talk, and I am announcing today the decisive action that the next Conservative Government will take.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "We will focus on what works. And what works in the teaching of reading is the proven, traditional method of phonics. In particular, what experts call \u2018synthetic phonics\u2019, which has been shown to improve pupils\u2019 reading scores dramatically in Scotland. Children are taught letter sounds and how they blend into words, before being taught letter combinations and to work from sounds to letters.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "It\u2019s not rocket science, but it is not what Labour\u2019s much-heralded National Literacy Strategy has delivered. The Education Secretary claimed last month that the strategy was \u2018almost entirely based on synthetic phonics\u2019 , but reading experts have specifically rejected her claim, saying \u2018this is not the case\u2019, and that Labour\u2019s approach puts \u2018considerable emphasis\u2019 on other, less effective methods .\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "As the Reading Reform Foundation has argued, this fudged strategy \u2018dilutes the effectiveness\u2019 of the guidance, and means teachers \u2018continue to be confused by the increasing amount of contradictory phonics advice\u2019 .\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "This cannot continue. As Education Secretary I will not allow any more of our children to become the unfortunate victims of failed educational experiments. And I will not allow teachers to be put in the impossible situation of being asked to deliver mutually contradictory approaches.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "So the next Conservative Government will replace the present National Literacy Strategy with new guidance based wholly and exclusively on synthetic phonics. We will not waste time commissioning yet more reports and pilot projects. The evidence is there, and it is clear. We will act on it.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Doing this will particularly help those pupils for whom English is a second language, giving them the extra support they need to make the most of the educational opportunities available to them. It cannot be right that such children are allowed to continue to struggle, and that divisions in our society risk being entrenched as a result.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "As Michael rightly says, it is in all our interests that people who choose to make their home here are helped to learn the language of our nation. And a return to traditional teaching methods will help to achieve that. As the Select Committee found, synthetic phonics are \u2018of particular benefit to children at risk of reading difficulties\u2019.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Mr Blair has had eight years to deliver on his promises, and has failed. Where Labour offer more talk, we will take firm action.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
