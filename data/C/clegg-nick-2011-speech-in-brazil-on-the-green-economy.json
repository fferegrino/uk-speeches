        "\u201cI have to confess: this is my first trip to Brazil. But I have wanted to come here for many years.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cLike all of your visitors, I\u2019ve been struck by Brazil\u2019s beauty, your hospitality. But, more than anything, by your sense of pride, of confidence. By the sense that right here, right now, so much is possible.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s no real surprise, of course.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cIn just a few decades Brazil has undergone a transformation that takes most countries centuries.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cDemocracy, growth, economic development. Millions lifted out of poverty \u2013 24 million in just eight years. A voice on the global stage that grows stronger by the day.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cIn all of history has a country ever risen so dramatically, so peacefully, attracting such global goodwill?\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cBrazil was once described as a country of the future; clearly now it\u2019s the future that belongs to Brazil.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cAnd it\u2019s our shared future I want to talk about today. A new partnership between Brazil and the UK. A partnership for prosperity, where we work together to generate wealth and opportunity for our people.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cTrading more, learning from each other as we reform our economies, but also standing shoulder to shoulder in the world to advance our common values: democracy, fairness, economic openness, multilateralism.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cBecause, in the long-term, that\u2019s how we create the peaceful and stable world in which we both can thrive.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cBefore I talk about how we can work together more closely, let me set out why I believe we can.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cHistory shows that UK-Brazil relations matter.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cIn the nineteenth century Britain supported and helped in Brazil\u2019s war of liberation and negotiated Portuguese recognition of Brazilian independence.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cA hundred years later, as Europe was torn apart by unprecedented destruction, Brazilian soldiers fought with us, helping to defeat the forces of fascism. Making sacrifices for which we will always be grateful.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cOurs has long been a reciprocal friendship, a two-way friendship between nations that stand together when it counts.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",

        "\u201cWe don\u2019t trade enough. We don\u2019t share knowledge in the way we could. We don\u2019t automatically think of each other as allies in the world.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cTrue, recent years have seen some improvement \u2013 in business and investment; in cooperation in defence, and on development policy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cWe worked together effectively on biodiversity at Nagoya, and on climate change at Cancun.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t want to downplay that progress. But we must be much more ambitious about what we can achieve together.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cThere remains great potential for Brazil and the UK to do more.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cAs part of a new and lasting period of engagement between our great nations. Modern nations. Reforming nations. Nations that do not look at the world as it once was, but who see it for what it is today, what it will be tomorrow.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cAnd who understand that, on all of our big challenges \u2013 tackling global warming, setting the world on a path of sustainable growth, eliminating poverty and disease, fighting terrorism and organised crime \u2013 on all of them we are stronger together than we are apart.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cAt the heart of this partnership are our values.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cThe world is often carved up according to imaginary lines: North/South; East/West; Developed/Developing.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cBut the real divide is about what you believe.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cThere are closed societies: where power is abused, liberty curtailed, opportunity hoarded, and governments look inwards as the rest of the world is shut out.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cAnd there are open societies: internationalist in spirit, committed to fairness, freedom and democracy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cBrazil and the UK stand on the same side of that divide.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cOf course, in any genuine, equal partnership there will be give and take. Moments when we don\u2019t agree.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cWe look, for example, for the same outcomes in the Arab world, yet we sometimes differ on the best way to achieve them. And, when we disagree, we should be upfront about it.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cHowever, I believe, ultimately, we can be confident about navigating those moments.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cConfident that, while we may differ on the means, we nearly always agree on the ends and, in our heads and in our hearts, we are usually coming from the same place.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cSo how do we deepen our ties?\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cThe first part of the answer is trade.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cFor the UK, this visit is, ultimately a trade mission. If that sounds hardheaded, that\u2019s because it is.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cTrade means jobs. That\u2019s what the people of the UK want.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cBut never underestimate the cohesive power of trade.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cIt brings people together, fostering new understandings. Not between governments, or diplomats, but people; businesses; their staff; and their communities too.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cTrade ensures nations have a stake in each other\u2019s success. In working together peacefully, constructively, and towards the same goals.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cSo I\u2019m delighted to unveil new business contracts between UK and Brazilian companies worth \u00a32.5bn to the UK economy \u2013 a significant boost.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cBT, BP, BG \u2013 British companies, doing more business in Brazil, bringing the benefits home.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cContracts that boost the bright futures of some of our most iconic businesses, like Rolls Royce and JCB, both of which are expanding operations here in Brazil.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cContracts that filter down the supply chain.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cFor example, by underwriting a credit line for Brazilian steelmaker Gerdau, the UK government has secured \u00a3270 million worth of exports from the UK, with orders placed with dozens of companies around the country.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cAnd contracts that help the UK rebalance our economy away from our previous overreliance on a limited number of sectors, with deals in telecoms, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals \u2013 some of the key industries to the UK\u2019s future success.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cI\u2019m accompanied by a business delegation, representing energy, infrastructure, engineering, financial services, to name a few. Here to promote the UK as one of the easiest places on the planet to do business \u2013 that\u2019s according to the World Bank \u2013 as well as a gateway to global markets.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cAnd we are deeply ambitious about what we want to achieve.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cNothing short of a new era in expanded trade and booming business between our two nations.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cIt is true that the UK was hit hard by the global financial crisis, and the UK Government is having to implement a decisive plan for fiscal consolidation, cutting spending and raising some taxes too.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cBut, by doing so, we have retained the confidence of international markets and gained the backing of major international institutions, including the IMF, the EU, and OECD.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cWe are also reforming our financial sector so that risk is better managed, and the wider economy is better insulated from shocks.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cSo the UK should be an attractive destination for Brazilian investment. And we offer a different kind of deal.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cWe know what the Brazilian economy already excels at.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cWe know too how many international partnerships you have forged.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cBut the great challenge for all advanced economies in the 21st century is to stay smart. To get ahead of the curve \u2013 in technology, in education, in energy efficiency, effective regulation and public services.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cThat is where we can help. Ours is a dynamic, agile, and innovative economy.Where we value sustainability, where we recognise the need to confront structural barriers to growth.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re focusing resources on schools and training. We\u2019re reforming higher education to keep our universities world class, and we\u2019re building on our world-class research base to get further ahead in the industries of the twenty first century: green technology, renewable energy, aerospace, and many more.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s a long-term view. Looking beyond the next year, or the year after. Looking decades ahead.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cBecause that is the key to growth that lasts.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cI know Brazil is also thinking not only of today. That you are lifting your sights to the horizon. And on that we can help each other too.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cWe can learn from each other to diversify our economies, drawing on each others\u2019 expertise.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cYour success in biofuels and renewable energy. Our experience in carbon trading and our new Green Investment bank \u2013 a world first.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cYour groundbreaking welfare programmes. Our insights in education.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cWe can pass on lessons from our preparations for London 2012 to help deliver a successful Rio 2016.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cPerhaps, in return, you can tell us the secret of how to win five world cups.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s a new way of working together \u2013 a step change in our relationship.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cThis week we are agreeing UK/Brazilian cooperation that \u2013 in its scope and depth \u2013 has never been seen before.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cOn crime, to tackle drugs here in Brazil and help get cocaine off the UK\u2019s streets too.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cOn international development, to combine our efforts and help some of the world\u2019s poorest.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cOn the upcoming Rio +20 conference \u2013 twenty years on from the 1992 Earth Summit \u2013 to set out a plan for sustainable global growth.Never have our nations agreed to work so closely, on so many issues\u2026Coming together for our common good.  \nAnd as we move forward together, we must recognise that this partnership is not just about what we can do, directly, with each other, but also what we do, together, in the wider world.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cBecause our fortunes do not exist in a vacuum. They depend on the health of the global economy within which we operate and, following the global financial crisis, that economy is still not in a good state.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cDifferent countries have weathered the storm differently. Brazil has dealt with it extremely well.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cYou were the last into recession and the first out \u2013 and, again, there are lessons we want to learn.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cAnd the challenges nations face are also different.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cIn the UK we are dealing with the consequences of years of excessive debt, private and public.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cIn Brazil, you are thinking more about the dangers associated with rising inflation.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cIn the UK we are having to rebalance our economy by moving away from private consumption and government expenditure, towards net exports and investment. That, along with fiscal consolidation, will help deliver sustainable growth.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cFor so-called emerging nations, on the other hand, rebalancing means deepening domestic markets to increase consumption and spread the benefits of prosperity.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cBut what is the same is that, for either of us to meet those challenges, we both need a global economic environment able to withstand shocks.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cWhere we strive for steady and sustainable global growth based on stable finances, built on responsible financial markets and underpinned by political stability.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cThat means effective international institutions. And it\u2019s on that point that I would like to finish.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cIn our interdependent economy, multilateralism is not a luxury, it\u2019s a must.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cBut our institutions must be more nimble. Better equipped to guard against risk, respond to crises, enforce rules and norms that advance our shared success.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cThat will be impossible until those institutions are reformed to suit the modern world. Until they reflect today\u2019s geography of power, with all of the major powers properly heard. Nations \u2013 like Brazil \u2013 who should be shaping the agenda, offering unique insights, being part of the big decisions, and then using your power to see those decisions through.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cHuge strides have been taken in establishing multilateral cooperation over the last sixty years, but the reality is, unless new actors are brought fully into the multilateral system, they will increasingly look for other ways to operate and our international institutions will become increasingly defunct.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cThe UK doesn\u2019t want to see that happen.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s why we actively support a permanent seat for Brazil at the UN Security Council.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cWe pushed for the recent changes to IMF voting weights, to more fairly distribute influence. Changes we\u2019re ratifying through our Parliament, without delay.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cAnd we want the G20 to continue as an effective, inclusive forum where we address global economic challenges.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cSo it\u2019s time for old powers to make space.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cWe want you with us, fully represented.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cBut \u2013 of course \u2013 fully responsible too.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cBeing a full member of the club is one thing, but it becomes meaningless unless we all make sure that club works.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cSo our nations must be activists for the things we believe in.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cWe see Brazil doing that more and more, whether by standing up for human rights or helping deliver peace and stability \u2013 not least through your leadership of the UN Stabilisation Mission in Haiti.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cThat increased engagement bodes well for the future. Because the world needs an active Brazil, fighting for progress on a fair, global trade round.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cUsing your experience and growing influence to help secure stability in the Middle East. Helping implement the climate change commitments agreed in Cancun. And building on them to deliver a successful Durban Summit at the end of the year.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u201cPromoting democracy because you know from your own experience that in underpins stability and success.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
