        "I have today stood down as MP for West Lancashire to take up the role as Chairman of Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Representing West Lancashire in Parliament for the past 17 years has been the greatest honour of my lifetime. I am immensely grateful for the confidence that my constituents placed in me, across 5 elections, to be their voice in Westminster.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "I leave with a heavy heart, knowing that despite my efforts to distance myself from events in the past, the choice of broadcasters to re-tell this story is out of my control. I hope in the future, production companies will be more considerate of the effect that these programmes and the publicity campaign surrounding them, will have on the victims of crimes regardless of how public that crime was.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "I am, however, thrilled to be moving on to a new role within the NHS. Protecting and improving the health service has always been a great passion of mine. I am taking up this responsibility at a time when the challenges facing the NHS have never been more apparent.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
