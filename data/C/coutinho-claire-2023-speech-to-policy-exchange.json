        "It was your report on \u2018Academic Freedom in the UK\u2019, that planted the seeds for our Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Bill \u2013 and I stand here, three years after the Bill was introduced, with the Act having received Royal Assent.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "At a time when many were closing their eyes to the problem and saying there was nothing to see, Policy Exchange\u2019s research shone a light on why we needed to act.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "Curious students are being deprived of attending events, visiting speakers are intimidated by aggressive protests, and in the worst cases, academics are losing their livelihoods \u2013 and their reputations \u2013 for the crime of expressing an opinion.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "Activists who can fire off a lot of tweets and draft open letters \u2013 not simply to express their own opinion, but to close down a wider debate \u2013 and by now, we\u2019ve seen the dangers of how this manifests itself on campus.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "If you\u2019re Kathleen Stock, you\u2019ll be hounded out of your job by a toxic, organised campaign to get you fired.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "We\u2019ve even heard of examples of research projects on the culture of censorship in universities being censored because they\u2019re deemed \u2018too dangerous\u2019.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "It\u2019s even spread to disciplines as far from politics as you can imagine, such as maths.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "I met with a group of mathematicians who were being pressured into \u2018decolonising\u2019 their maths curriculum by downplaying or magnifying the work of mathematicians depending on their race.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "And yet some people see even this discipline \u2013 the purest of all sciences and one which has developed across borders for more than a millennium \u2013 as an outlet for their activism instead of being motivated by a love of their subject and the pursuit of truth.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The experience of those mathematicians is one shared by many in academia. An insidious censorship bubbling away under the surface, where students and academics with mainstream views don\u2019t say what they think because they\u2019re scared of the consequences for their studies or their career.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "But a tolerant society isn\u2019t one where everyone must conform to a narrow, ideological vision of moral virtue \u2013 where only those who take a certain point of view are allowed to speak their mind \u2013 a tolerant society is one which allows us to understand people we disagree with, and where minority and majority views are protected.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "It should be a university\u2019s duty to stay neutral, to facilitate debate and to protect those who put minority views forward in good faith.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Universities fail in that duty when they themselves take sides on these contested issues.

        "This will have wider effects than those faced by the individuals involved. For example, there is even evidence that shows that academic freedom boosts innovation.
