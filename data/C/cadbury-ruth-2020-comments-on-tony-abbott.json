        "The Minister said that he welcomed the Government\u2019s appointment of Tony Abbott as a trade adviser, but on Sky this morning, Kay Burley reminded the Health Secretary that the appointee is a misogynist and homophobe, which the International Trade Secretary\u2019s colleague appeared to confirm by saying, \u201cBut he\u2019s also an expert on trade.\u201d Could the International Trade Secretary not find an expert for the role who demonstrates positive British values and, by the way, is not a climate change denier?"
