        "Tax paid by the motorist up by an extra \u00a313 billion a year \u2013 up yet again last week \u2013 yet we have had the smallest road-building programme since the Second World War.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "Even worse there is the national scandal of the West Coast Main Line. After billions and billions of pounds of spending, and after months of disruption for engineering work \u2013 all designed to enable trains to run faster and to shorten journey times between the North West and London, we have just had the new autumn timetable published. The good news is that there is a 40 minute difference between the old time and the new time for getting from Oxenholme in my Cumbrian constituency to London. The bad news is that this is an extra 40 minutes \u2013 meaning that journeys which took three and a half hours ten years ago will be taking four and a half hours in year 7 of this Labour Government. Your money, ladies and gentlemen, is going straight down the plughole \u2013 and we all have every reason to be furious about it.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "Ten years ago Mr Blair used to tell a story. While canvassing he met a man washing his Mondeo, who said he\u2019d never dream of voting Labour. Mr Blair spent years wooing Mondeo Man. What he never said was that in office he\u2019d try to ensure the only thing you could afford to do with a Mondeo is wash it.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "The Lib Dems just offer the same as Labour but with added spite. Even more congestion charging. Even higher motoring taxes. Even less road-building.

        "They stopped building new, safer roads \u2013 in 2001, not one inch of tarmac was added to the national road network.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "And they have used speed cameras to replace, not supplement, traffic patrols. Under Labour, police officers on traffic duties have been cut by nearly 10%. As Chief Superintendent Mike McAndrew, former head of traffic policing for the Met, has said \u201cspeed on its own is not the real killer \u2013 it\u2019s dangerous driving.\u201d Without enough traffic patrols, he says, \u201cpeople who drive dangerously, recklessly and carelessly don\u2019t get caught\u201d.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "Enough is enough.

        "We will boost the numbers of traffic patrols. Improve driver education.

        "Greater safety also comes from new roads.

        "Unlike Labour, we don\u2019t aim to obliterate every last blade of grass in southern England. Our approach will ease overheating in the South \u2013 a sensible regional policy, respect for the Green Belt and, at last, firm and fair immigration and asylum rules to cut the numbers moving here from abroad.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "And of course we\u2019ll keep the presumption, placed into law by the last Conservative Government, against major road developments in National Parks or Areas of Natural Beauty.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "International experience shows that higher and more rigorously observed limits on motorways, combined with lower limits on small roads, strongly help to reduce road casualties.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "That\u2019s why we will on entering office immediately start a swift and comprehensive review of speed limits. It\u2019s likely to mean raising the motorway limit to 80 mph while providing lower limits \u2013 of 20 mph or below \u2013 near schools or in small communities.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "Because of it, we spend far more public money on rail safety than on road safety, putting a small chance of saving a few lives ahead of much better prospects of saving far more.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Because of it, we saw a 3 month shutdown of London\u2019s Central Line after an incident with no serious injuries \u2013 even though that caused tens of thousands to travel at far greater risk on the roads.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "And because of it, we saw a collapse of rail performance after Hatfield, causing many to switch to riskier road journeys.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "In the same way thousands of speed bumps were constructed, often thoughtlessly \u2013 when the London Ambulance Service say more die because ambulances are slowed than are saved by the bumps.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "So a narrow obsession with health and safety is endangering lives, not saving them.

        "So my second announcement today is that Conservatives will concentrate on the big risks, not the small ones.

        "We\u2019ll be creative about transport solutions in the big cities \u2013 we\u2019ll explore entirely private sector means to build London\u2019s Crossrail, and welcome the thinking by Birmingham Conservatives about a privately funded new Tube.

        "So my third announcement is a radical slimming for the bloated Strategic Rail Authority. We doubt it makes sense to have three different public sector bodies \u2013 all created by Labour \u2013 supervising the rail network.

        "In London, Steve Norris is campaigning vigorously against Ken Livingstone\u2019s Congestion Charge \u2013 not least because instead of the promised millions for public transport it is so off beam that it actually means less money for public transport. And we will resist Labour\u2019s plan for the greatest stealth tax of all: charging 50p a mile for using roads we\u2019ve already paid for many times over.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "My final announcement concerns the purpose of the Department for Transport.
