        "I am so proud to stand here today as Prime Minister of four nations in one United Kingdom.",
        "I was always clear about why we called that referendum.",
        "Duck the fight \u2013 and our union could have been taken apart bit by bit.",
        "Take it on \u2013 and we had the chance to settle the question.",
        "This Party has always confronted the big issues for the sake of our country.",
        "And now\u2026",
        "\u2026England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland\u2026",
        "\u2026we are one people in one union and everyone here can be proud of that.",
        "And we can all agree, during that campaign a new star \u2013 a new Conservative star \u2013 was born\u2026",
        "\u2026someone who\u2019s going to take our message to every corner of Scotland: our very own Ruth Davidson.",
        "The lead-up to that referendum was the most nerve-wracking week of my life.",
        "But I can tell you the best moment of my year.",
        "It was June 6th, the 70th anniversary of D Day.",
        "Sam and I were in Bayeux, in France, with my constituent, Patrick Churchill\u2026",
        "\u2026no relation to the great man \u2013 but a great man himself.",
        "Patrick is 91 years old \u2013 and 70 years ago, he was there fighting fascism, helping to liberate that town.",
        "I\u2019ll never forget the tears in his eyes as he talked about the comrades he left behind..",
        "\u2026or the pride they all felt in the job they had done.",
        "As we walked along the streets he pointed out where he had driven his tank\u2026",
        "\u2026and all along the roadside there were French children waving flags \u2013 Union Jacks \u2013 the grandchildren of the people he had liberated.",
        "Patrick\u2019s here today with his wife Karin \u2013 and I know, like me, you\u2019ll want to give them the warmest welcome.",
        "When people have seen our flag \u2013 in some of the most desperate times in history \u2013 they have known what it stands for.",
        "Freedom. Justice. Standing up for what is right.",
        "They have known this isn\u2019t any old country.",
        "This is a special country.",
        "June 6th this summer. Normandy.",
        "I was so proud of Great Britain that day.",
        "And here, today, I want to set out how in this generation, we can build a country whose future we can all be proud of.",
        "How we can secure a better future for all.",
        "How we can build a Britain that everyone is proud to call home.",
        "The heirs to those who fought on the beaches of Northern France are those fighting in Afghanistan today.",
        "For thirteen years, young men and women have been serving our country there.",
        "This year, the last of our combat troops come home \u2013 and I know everyone here will want to show how grateful and how proud we are of everyone who served.",
        "But the end of the Afghan mission does not mean the end of the threat.",
        "The threat is Islamist extremist terrorism \u2013 and it has found a new, hellish crucible \u2013 with ISIL, in Iraq and Syria.",
        "These people are evil, pure and simple.",
        "They kill children; rape women; threaten non-believers with genocide; behead journalists and aid workers.",
        "Some people seem to think we can opt out of this. We can\u2019t.",
        "As I speak, British servicemen and women are flying in the skies over Iraq.",
        "They saw action yesterday.",
        "And there will be troops on the frontline \u2013 but they will be Iraqis, Kurds, and Syrians\u2026",
        "\u2026fighting for the safe and democratic future they deserve.",
        "We are acting in partnership with a range of countries \u2013 including those from the region.",

        "There is no \u201cwalk on by\u201d option.",
        "Unless we deal with ISIL, they will deal with us, bringing terror and murder to our streets.",
        "As always with this Party, we will do whatever it takes to keep our country safe.",
        "And to those who have had all the advantages of being brought up in Britain, but who want to go and fight for ISIL \u2013 let me say this.",
        "If you try to travel to Syria or Iraq, we will use everything at our disposal to stop you:",
        "Taking away your passport; prosecuting, convicting, imprisoning you\u2026",
        "\u2026and if you\u2019re there already \u2013 even preventing you from coming back.",
        "You have declared your allegiance.",
        "You are an enemy of the UK \u2013 and you should expect to be treated as such.",
        "When it comes to keeping Britain safe, I had one man by my side for four years.",
        "When he was a teenager, he didn\u2019t only address the Tory party conference\u2026",
        "\u2026he read Hansard in bed\u2026",
        "\u2026and had a record collection consisting of one album by Dire Straits and dozens of speeches by Winston Churchill.",
        "All I can say is this: that boy became a fine Parliamentarian\u2026",
        "\u2026a brilliant Foreign Secretary\u2026",
        "\u2026our greatest living Yorkshireman\u2026",
        "\u2026and someone to whom I owe an enormous debt of gratitude: William Hague.",
        "William, there\u2019s one more task I want you to carry out: bringing fairness to our constitution.",
        "During that referendum campaign we made a vow to the Scottish people that they will get more powers \u2013 and we will keep that vow.",
        "But here\u2019s my vow to the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
        "I know the system is unfair.",
        "I know that you are asking: if Scotland can vote separately on things like tax, spending and welfare\u2026.",
        "\u2026.why can\u2019t England, Wales and Northern Ireland do the same?",
        "I know you want this answered.",
        "So this is my vow: English votes for English laws \u2013 the Conservatives will deliver it.",
        "We\u2019ve delivered a lot these past four years\u2026",
        "\u2026but we\u2019ve had to do it all in a coalition government.",
        "Believe me: coalition was not what I wanted to do; it\u2019s what I had to do.",
        "And I know what I want next.",
        "To be back here in October 2015 delivering Conservative policies\u2026",
        "\u2026based on Conservative values\u2026",
        "\u2026leading a majority Conservative Government.",
        "So where do we want to take our country?",
        "Where do I want to take our country?",
        "During these four years, I hope that the British people have come to know me a little.",
        "I\u2019m not a complicated man. I believe in some simple things.",
        "Families come first. They are the way you make a nation strong from the inside out.",
        "I care deeply about those who struggle to get by\u2026",
        "\u2026but I believe the best thing to do is help them stand on their own two feet \u2013 and no, that\u2019s not saying \u201cyou\u2019re on your own\u201d, but \u201cwe are on your side, helping you be all you can.\u201d",
        "And I believe in something for something; not something for nothing.",
        "Those who do the right thing, put the effort in, who work and build communities \u2013 these are the people who should be rewarded.",
        "All of this is underpinned by a deep patriotism.",
        "I love this country \u2013 and my goal is this:",
        "To make Britain a country that everyone is proud to call home.",
        "That doesn\u2019t just mean having the fastest-growing economy, or climbing some international league table.",
        "I didn\u2019t come into politics to make the lines on the graphs go in the right direction.",
        "I want to help you live a better life.",
        "And it comes back to those things I believe.",
        "A Britain that everyone is proud to call home is a Britain where hard work is really rewarded.",
        "Not a free-for-all, but a chance for all\u2026",
        "\u2026the chance of a job, a home, a good start in life\u2026",
        "\u2026whoever you are, wherever you are from.",
        "And by the way \u2013 you never pull one person up by pulling another one down.",
        "So this Party doesn\u2019t do the politics of envy and class warfare\u2026",
        "\u2026we believe in aspiration and helping people get on in life \u2013 and what\u2019s more, we\u2019re proud of it.",
        "The past four years have been about laying the foundations for that Britain.",
        "The next five will be about finishing the job.",
        "Put another way \u2013 if our economic plan for the past four years has been about our country \u2013 and saving it from economic ruin\u2026",
        "\u2026our plan for the next five years will be about you, and your family \u2013 and helping you get on.",
        "But Conservatives know this.",
        "Nothing comes easy.",
        "There\u2019s no reward without effort; no wealth without work; no success without sacrifice\u2026",
        "\u2026and we credit the British people with knowing these things too.",
        "Other parties preach to you about a Brave New World\u2026",
        "\u2026we understand you have to start with the real world and make it better.",
        "So let other politicians stand on stages like this and promise an easy life. Not me.",
        "I am here today to set out our Conservative commitment for the next five years.",
        "If you want to provide for yourself and your family, you\u2019ll have the security of a job\u2026",
        "\u2026but only if we stick to our long-term economic plan.",
        "If you work hard, we will cut your taxes\u2026",
        "\u2026but only if we keep on cutting the deficit, so we can afford to do that.",
        "For those wanting to buy a home, yes \u2013 we will help you get on that housing ladder\u2026",
        "\u2026but only if we take on the vested interests, and build more homes \u2013 however hard that is.",
        "We will make sure your children get a great education; the best education\u2026",
        "\u2026but only if we keep taking on everyone who gets in the way of high standards.",
        "For those retiring, we will make sure you get a decent pension; and real rewards for a life of work\u2026",
        "\u2026but only if we as a country accept we all have to work a bit longer and save a bit more.",
        "It\u2019s pretty simple really: a good job, a nice home, more money at the end of the month, a decent education for your children, a safe and secure retirement.",
        "A country where if you put in, you get out.",
        "A Britain everyone is proud to call home.",
        "And a real long-term plan to get there.",
        "It starts with more decent jobs.",
        "And look how far we\u2019ve come.",
        "Today there are 1 million 800 thousand more jobs in our country than there were in 2010.",
        "We are creating more jobs here in Britain than in the whole of Europe put together.",
        "1.8 million jobs.",
        "You know \u2013 when Britain is getting back to work, it can only mean one thing\u2026",
        "\u2026the Conservatives are back in Government.",
        "So here\u2019s our commitment for the next five years.",
        "What the economists would call: the highest employment rate of any major economy.",
        "What I call: full employment in Britain.",
        "Just think of what that would mean.",
        "Those who can work, able to work\u2026",
        "\u2026standing on their own two feet, looking at their children and thinking \u201cI am providing for you.\u201d",
        "We can get there \u2013 but only if we stick to our plan.",
        "Companies are coming from all over the world to invest and create jobs here.",
        "That\u2019s not happened by accident.",
        "It\u2019s because they see a Government rolling out the red carpet for them, cutting their red tape, cutting their taxes.",
        "So here is a commitment: with the next Conservative Government \u2013 we will always have the most competitive corporate taxes in the G20\u2026",
        "\u2026lower than Germany, lower than Japan, lower than the United States.",
        "But George said something really important in that brilliant speech on Monday.",
        "A message to those global companies:",
        "We have cut your taxes \u2013 now you must pay what you owe.",
        "We must stick to the plan on welfare too.",
        "With us, if you\u2019re out of work, you will get unemployment benefit\u2026",
        "\u2026but only if you go to the Job Centre, update your CV, attend interviews and accept the work you\u2019re offered.",
        "As I said: no more something-for-nothing.",
        "And look at the results: 800,000 fewer people on the main out-of-work benefits.",
        "In the next five years we\u2019re going to go further.",
        "You heard it this week \u2013 we won\u2019t just aim to lower youth unemployment; we aim to abolish it.",
        "We\u2019ve made clear decisions.",
        "We will reduce the benefits cap, and we will say to those 21 and under: no longer will you have the option of leaving school and going straight into a life on benefits.",
        "You must earn or learn.",
        "And we will help by funding three million Apprenticeships.",
        "Let\u2019s say to our young people: a life on welfare is no life at all\u2026",
        "\u2026instead: here\u2019s some hope; here\u2019s a chance to get on and make something of yourself.",
        "What do our opponents have to say?",
        "They have opposed every change to welfare we\u2019ve made \u2013 and I expect they\u2019ll oppose this too.",
        "They sit there pontificating about poverty \u2013 yet they\u2019re the ones who left a generation to rot on welfare.",
        "And while we\u2019re at it: let\u2019s compare records.",
        "Under Labour, unemployment rose. With us, unemployment is falling faster than at any time for 25 years.",
        "Under Labour, inequality widened. With us, it\u2019s narrowed.",
        "Those are the facts.",
        "So let\u2019s say it loudly and proudly\u2026",
        "\u2026with Britain getting off welfare and back to work\u2026",
        "\u2026the real party of compassion and social justice today is here in this hall \u2013 the Conservative Party.",
        "It\u2019s not just the job numbers that matter \u2013 it is the reality of working life for people in our country\u2026",
        "\u2026especially the lowest-paid.",
        "Anyone should be free to take on different jobs so they can get on.",
        "But when companies employ staff on zero hours contracts and then stop them from getting work elsewhere, that\u2019s not a free market \u2013 it is a fixed market.",
        "In a Britain that everyone is proud to call home, people are employed, they are not used.",
        "Those exclusive zero hours contracts that left people unable to build decent lives for themselves \u2013 we will scrap them.",
        "But there\u2019s still more injustice when it comes to work, and it\u2019s even more shocking.",
        "Criminal gangs trafficking people halfway around the world and making them work in the most disgusting conditions.",
        "I\u2019ve been to see these \u2013 houses on terraced streets, built for families of four, cramming in 15 people like animals.",
        "To those crime lords who think they can get away with it, I say\u2026",
        "No: not in this country; not with this party.",
        "\u2026with our Modern Slavery Bill we\u2019re coming after you and we\u2019re going to put a stop to it once and for all.",
        "Once you have a job, I want you to take home more of your own money.",
        "If you put in, you should get out \u2013 not hand so much of it to the taxman.",
        "That\u2019s why these past four years, despite everything, I\u2019ve made sure we provide some relief to taxpayers in our country \u2013 especially the poorest.",
        "No income tax until you earn \u00a310,000 a year \u2013 and from next April, \u00a310,500 a year.",
        "Three million people taken out of income tax altogether.",
        "A tax cut for 25 million more.",
        "And our commitment to you for the next five years: we want to cut more of your taxes.",
        "But we can only do that if we keep on cutting the deficit.",
        "It\u2019s common sense \u2013 tax cuts need to be paid for.",
        "So here\u2019s our plan.",
        "We are going to balance the books by 2018, and start putting aside money for the future.",
        "To do it we\u2019ll need to find \u00a325 billion worth of savings in the first two years of the next Parliament.",
        "That\u2019s a lot of money, but it\u2019s doable.",
        "\u00a325 billion is actually just three per cent of what government spends each year.",
        "It is a quarter of the savings we have found in this Parliament.",
        "I am confident we will find the savings we need through spending cuts alone.",
        "We will see the job through and get back into the black.",
        "And as we do that, I am clear about something else.",
        "We need tax cuts for hardworking people.",
        "And here and now, I have a specific commitment.",
        "Today, the minimum wage reaches \u00a36.50 an hour, and before long we\u2019ll reach our next goal of \u00a37.",
        "I can tell you now that a future Conservative Government will raise the tax-free personal allowance from \u00a310,500 to \u00a312,500.",
        "That will take 1 million more of the lowest paid workers out of income tax \u2013 and will give a tax cut to 30 million more.",
        "So with us, if you work 30 hours a week on minimum wage, you will pay no income tax at all. Nothing. Zero. Zilch.",
        "Lower taxes for our hardworking people\u2026",
        "\u2026that\u2019s what I call a Britain that everyone is proud to call home.",
        "But we will do something else.",
        "The 40p tax rate was only supposed to be paid by the most well-off people in our country\u2026",
        "\u2026but in the past couple of decades, far too many have been dragged into it: teachers, police officers.",
        "So let me tell you this today.",
        "I want to take action that\u2019s long overdue, and bring back some fairness to tax.",
        "With a Conservative government, we will raise the threshold at which people pay the 40p rate.",
        "It\u2019s currently \u00a341,900\u2026",
        "\u2026in the next Parliament we will raise it to \u00a350,000.",
        "So here\u2019s our commitment to the British people:",
        "No income tax if you are on Minimum Wage.",
        "A 12 and a half thousand pound tax-free personal allowance for millions of hardworking people.",
        "And you only pay 40p tax when you earn \u00a350,000.",
        "So let the message go out:",
        "With the Conservatives, if you work hard and do the right thing\u2026",
        "\u2026we say you should keep more of your own money to spend as you choose.",
        "That\u2019s what our long-term economic plan means for you.",
        "And while I\u2019m on the subject of the big economic questions our country faces \u2013 on spending, on tax \u2013 did you hear Ed Miliband last week?",
        "He spoke for over an hour, but didn\u2019t mention the deficit once. Not once.",
        "He said he \u2018forgot\u2019 to mention it.",
        "Ed \u2013 people forget their car keys, school kids sometimes forget their homework\u2026",
        "\u2026but if you want to be Prime Minister of this country, you cannot forget the biggest challenge we face.",
        "A few weeks ago, Ed Balls said that in thirteen years of Government, Labour had made \u2018some mistakes\u2019.",
        "\u2018Some mistakes\u2019.",
        "Excuse me?",
        "You were the people who left Britain with the biggest peacetime deficit in history\u2026",
        "\u2026who gave us the deepest recession since the war\u2026",
        "\u2026who destroyed our pensions system, bust our banking system\u2026",
        "\u2026who left a million young people out of work, five million on out-of-work benefits \u2013 and hundreds of billions of debt.",
        "Some mistakes?",
        "Labour were just one big mistake.",
        "And five years on, they still want to spend more, borrow more, tax more.",
        "It\u2019s the same old Labour, and you know what?",
