    "content": [
        "Good morning everybody. I\u2019m very pleased to be with you today and honoured to have been asked to address you at this important event. Thank you Polly for inviting me.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I head up the Troubled Families programme for government, a programme to turn around the lives of 120,000 families where kids aren\u2019t going to school, where youth crime and anti-social behaviour are a problem and where parents are out of work.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Before taking on this role, I did other jobs on victims, crime, anti-social behaviour and homelessness for governments of different persuasions.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Some of you will know me from the voluntary sector and I have had a long association with Women\u2019s Aid and others from the sector represented in the room today.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I know times are hard, austerity measures are tough and I can see that many colleagues out there are struggling.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I know that you are doing very difficult jobs in difficult circumstances and so I hope you\u2019ll take what I have to say today as an important recognition of the work you do day in day out.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I\u2019m glad that you\u2019ve given me the chance to share with you some reflections, having spent 2 years in this job listening to troubled families from cities to shires and to the workers who help them change.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "It would be true to say that I rarely have a conversation with troubled families where domestic violence does not feature.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Most troubled families I meet, yes, they are families where no one is working, where children don\u2019t go to school, where there is anti-social behaviour and crime.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "They are also, in many cases, families where parents themselves grew up with violence, families where mothers have fled violence only to end up with another controlling man.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Whether domestic violence is the cause or the symptom, what I have learnt from listening to them is that:\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u2013 their problems are multiple\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u2013 their problems layer one on top of the other\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u2013 and their problems are intergenerational\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "When I listen to troubled families, they nearly all talk about:\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u2013 a history of physical violence and sexual abuse, often going back generations\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u2013 the involvement of the care system in the lives of both parents and their children\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u2013 parents starting to have children very young and being unable to deal with them\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u2013 those parents in violent relationships\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u2013 and the children going on to have behavioural problems\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u2013 leading to exclusion from school, anti-social behaviour, crime and worklessness\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "These are families on the edge in every way \u2013 on the edge of eviction, on the edge of custody, on the edge of care.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "What shocks me more than their problems in a way is the normalisation of those problems \u2013 the matter of fact way they accept what has happened and is happening to them, because it is \u2018normal\u2019 in their experience, it was \u2018normal\u2019 when they were growing up.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "A few months back, I met a woman called Linda, 28 years old, 3 children from 3 different fathers.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Her 14 year old girl out of school, committing crime, hanging around with older men who did not see her as a child.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Her 13 year old sister not in school enough and too much at home or on the street and following in the footsteps of her sister.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Finally, Linda had brought an 8 year old into this world with another man and endured 8 years of violence at his hands, witnessed by that 8 year old child and the 2 teenage girls.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Linda had been caught for shoplifting and other thieving and was under a probation order. Family intervention got involved when she stopped turning up to see her probation officer.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "When I met her, I asked her how she ended up there and she told me she\u2019d experienced violence and abuse throughout her childhood. She had her first child at 14, a series of violent partners, she got addicted to drugs.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Taking Linda, a woman who has lived a life of abuse, who is from a family of abusers and simply categorising her as a shoplifter and dealing with her shoplifting would not get us anywhere.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Helping her deal with domestic violence was central to her recovery. Now, the violent man is out of her life, she\u2019s off drugs and all 3 kids are back in school.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Last week, we sent out a survey to all 152 local authority troubled families coordinators asking them about domestic violence.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Within hours, I had responses from 55 councils \u2013 that shows me for a start, it\u2019s a big issue for them.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "By the end of the week over 100 of the 152 had replied. Every single one of them said that they use domestic violence as a local criteria for including families in the troubled families programme.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "In this survey, we also asked about the levels of domestic violence in the families being worked with in the troubled families programme.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Four in 10 said that domestic violence is an issue in more than half of their cases. For some it\u2019s a problem in more than 3 quarters of the families they work with.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "So, in turning around the lives of 22,000 families which colleagues in local areas have done so far, we have learnt a lot through this process, that these families are best helped with family intervention, but as part of that, the domestic violence must be dealt with.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Can I explain quickly what I mean by family intervention. It is:\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u2013 a dedicated worker dedicated to the family \u2013 someone who the family knows by name and who is alongside them helping them to change; not making an assessment, going away and sending them a letter 6 weeks later\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u2013 that dedicated worker needs an assertive and challenging approach \u2013 they don\u2019t go away when the door is closed in their face or back off when a family won\u2019t engage\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u2013 that dedicated, assertive worker needs to look at what\u2019s really happening for the family as a whole \u2013 but in situations where there is violence or coercive control, looking at what\u2019s happening for the family as a whole may mean actually helping to get him out of the house or rescuing her to a place of safety\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u2013 the worker gives practical hands-on support \u2013 so in 1 family I met the breakthrough with the mother came when the worker sorted out beds for the kids and a skip for all the rubbish in the garden, which included all the internal doors in the house\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "The mother then told her that the reason the doors were all off their hinges and dumped in the garden was because the kids had asked for them to be taken off. Although the man was now gone, following years of violence in the house, they were terrified of what went on behind closed doors.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And the mother was overwhelmed. You could classify this as a domestic violence case mental health case, you could classify it as an anti-social behaviour case, you could classify it as a rent arrears case.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "But it was a troubled families case, where the mum and the family were living with a legacy of domestic violence and the bridge-building with that woman started with a practical solution and a skip.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And finally for family intervention to work, other agencies need to agree to the plan for the family \u2013 specialist workers may need to be called in at the right time, but essentially, the mantra is 1 family, 1 plan, 1 worker.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "What is clear when talking to families and to workers is that 5 factors of family intervention I\u2019ve just described are underpinned and made possible by the relationship built by the worker with the family.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "This is something you may see and do in your day to day work.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Good workers start not with a long list of agencies\u2019 requirements but by finding out where the family want to start.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "They are curious about their lives, their past, their interactions with each other.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "It\u2019s striking that families often say, \u2018nobody had ever asked me that before\u2019.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Nobody had asked the right question before that meant the mother opened up about the abuse in her past.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Nobody had ever elicited before the level of the violence from her current partner.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Good workers go into people\u2019s homes and uncover what\u2019s really going on.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "We know that when troubled families cases are referred, they are not always referred because of domestic violence. We find that out once the worker has gone in. It is only by working with the family that we find out is really happening.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Violence has not been reported and the signs of violence have not been put together: the police callouts logged as non-crime; the child out of school because they don\u2019t want to leave their mother; the regular visits to GP complaining of unspecified problems, or repeat sleeping pill prescriptions, anti-depressants, or hair falling out.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "As one troubled families co-ordinator said that while more than 3 quarters of their cases involved domestic violence they rarely know about it until after they\u2019ve started work with the family \u2013 they uncover it once they\u2019re in the home.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Sometimes that\u2019s because data isn\u2019t shared. Sometimes that\u2019s because women keep violence a secret, for fear of losing their children; or because when they did make a disclosure, the right help wasn\u2019t there.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Sometimes that\u2019s because the consequences of facing up to a violent relationship \u2013 leaving with all that this entails \u2013 are just too much.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Problems with money, problems with housing, problems having to uproot your kids. As one local coordinator of domestic violence services said to me the other day, \u2018the thing is, there can be so much to lose when they leave\u2019.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And they\u2019re afraid. They\u2019re afraid if they stay and they\u2019re afraid if you go. The fear is overwhelming.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "That\u2019s where the right intervention from the right person at the right time comes in.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "So one worker talked to me about a family where she only ever saw the mum. \u2018Where\u2019s their dad?\u2019 she asked. \u2018Oh, he\u2019s upstairs, he doesn\u2019t come down in the day\u2019. And yet it was obvious he was a controlling influence in the house \u2013 the kids were told they\u2019d be sent up to see him if they misbehaved. There was a sense of fear.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "It is not that family intervention workers are \u2018jacks of all trades\u2019, they are masters of one \u2013 the relationship.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Good workers are both kind and tough.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I\u2019m always struck when I meet these families that so many, if not all, of the influences in their lives are negative \u2013 they are so isolated.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "The relationship with the worker is not a friendship; it is more like a life buoy in a storm, until they can be pulled to a place of safety and away from a place of danger.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And that\u2019s what a refuge is too of course. It\u2019s not just commissioning bricks and mortar. It is more than a roof over someone\u2019s head.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of need shows us that basic needs for food, shelter and safety must be met first, then we can hope to improve someone\u2019s self-esteem and relationships with others.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "The key therefore to all of this is the relationship, the human interaction.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "It is not when someone is told they must change, but when someone comes along with the skill to make them feel they want to change.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I don\u2019t want to make this sound easy \u2013 none of this is easy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Not for the mother, not for the families, not for the system.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Nearly 2 years ago, I met a young woman who I\u2019ll call Carly. Carly had been with a violent partner for years. He had actually been imprisoned for violence towards her in the past, but she hadn\u2019t left him. They had a 6 year old child together and she was expecting a second child.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Both her 6 year old and unborn child were on the child protection register.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I\u2019m quoting now from the worker who first came into Carly\u2019s life at this low point. She said:\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "_Carly bore the whole responsibility for the relationship and the protection of the children absolutely fell to Carly._\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "She was told what she needed to do but not how to and she was left to do it all. It was Carly who had to keep him away when he came out of prison, it was Carly this and Carly that and it was about making sure it was achievable because you know, it\u2019s one thing saying you must not allow him into your property, but if he wants to come to that property and put a brick through your window he is going to come and do that.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "There was a day when they were doing activities with the child and Carly had a black eye and when asked what happened, she said she fell or something and I just went over and said, \u2018you\u2019re lying\u2019.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I said I can go and find out whether you\u2019re lying because you must either have been to hospital or the police were called. And because by that time we had a relationship, I could challenge her. And then we talked about what her options were.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And we said we\u2019re not leaving you to the wolves, we aren\u2019t leaving you.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "So for Carly, having that worker alongside her, knowing she wasn\u2019t going to be \u2018left to the wolves\u2019, gave her the courage to leave that violent man, the strength to stay away for good and the determination to be a good mother to her children.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "A year after I first met Carly, I went back to see her again. She looked like a different woman. Her children were off child protection, they were thriving and she was thinking about her future in a different way \u2013 she actually joked with me that she wanted to become a family intervention worker, so important had that relationship been to her.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "But it wasn\u2019t easy, not for Carly and not for the worker.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I\u2019m quoting again from Carly\u2019s worker:\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "It is uncomfortable stuff we do \u2013 we have to put ourselves in an uncomfortable situation because that\u2019s what we\u2019re asking of the families.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "People working with these families may well be working in an \u2018uncomfortable\u2019 space. It\u2019s not always a cosy, comfortable relationship. There has to be challenge as well as support.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "Serious case review after serious case review talks about a lack of challenge by professionals. It is not easy to ask the most uncomfortable questions or think the unthinkable. It wasn\u2019t easy for Carly\u2019s worker to say to her, \u2018Look, I know you\u2019re lying\u2019.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "We have to ask ourselves does this parent have the capability, the capacity and the willingness to change?\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "This isn\u2019t easy for the system, but we\u2019ve got to be tough where people won\u2019t change. There\u2019s a balancing act between the rights of the child and the rights of the woman and to be frank, taking entrenched positions doesn\u2019t help.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "And within that, we must acknowledge that domestic violence is overwhelmingly perpetrated by men against women.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "We all know the statistics \u2013 women make up 89% of those who are repeat victims of violence. Two women die every week at the hands of their male partners or ex partners.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "So when I talk about violence in the wider context of the family, in no way do I want to divert attention from that reality. I\u2019m not suggesting domestic violence affects everyone equally, regardless of gender.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "But what we are seeing in these families are the consequences of violence being left to fester:\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u2013 the transmission of violence from one generation to the next\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u2013 the effects on children as they grow up\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "\u2013 and violence becoming the normal way of life\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "In one case I know of, Debbie was the victim of domestic violence, and her children had witnessed their father abusing her. He had also lent her out to other men for sex.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "When the family intervention worker asked her about the past, Debbie said that growing up her partner had watched his step-father battering his mother, his mother was violent to her children and his brother remembers \u2018battering a lad with a wooden handle\u2019 at primary school; another brother had tried to strangle him.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "I\u2019m not making excuses for this man\u2019s violent behaviour \u2013 I\u2019m trying to illustrate that violence is intergenerational and its destruction can spread throughout the family.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "It often doesn\u2019t take long for the pattern of violence to start repeating itself.
