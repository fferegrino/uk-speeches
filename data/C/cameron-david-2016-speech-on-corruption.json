        "**Introduction**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Today the world has come together in a coalition of the committed to expose, punish and drive out corruption.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "This has been the first summit of its kind and the biggest demonstration of the political will to address corruption that we have seen for many, many years.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Frankly we\u2019ve known for years what a problem this is; we\u2019ve known for years it prevents us from achieving so many things we want to fix in our world.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But I\u2019ve really sensed today there is far more political will \u2013 not just from words but from actions \u2013 that will make a difference.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "There\u2019s nothing as powerful than an idea whose time has come and I believe that\u2019s the case with fighting and driving our corruption.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "When the UK hosted the G8 in Lough Erne in 2013, we took what many had seen as a series of technical issues around tax, trade and transparency and we showed how political will could begin a concerted effort to get to grips with tax evasion, aggressive tax avoidance and corporate secrecy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "When we first talked about ideas like automatic exchange of tax information and registries of who owns each company, many people, I think, wondered what on earth we were on about, and whether any of these things would actually happen.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But now 129 jurisdictions have committed to implementing the international standard for exchange of tax information on request \u2013 and more than 95 have committed to implementing the new global common reporting standard on tax transparency.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And as the Head of the OECD Angel Gurr\u00eda has said today, this started, in his words, a \u201cdramatic revolution\u201d that has since brought in 50 billion euros in extra tax revenue and has the potential with automatic exchange of information to bring in 200 billion more. Think of the schools, the hospitals, the roads, the services that could be provided and are needlessly lost.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Today\u2019s summit has built on these foundations.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Today it\u2019s not just the G8, but representatives from over 40 countries.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Not just political leaders but leaders from business, civil society and sport too, all working together to produce a series of ground-breaking commitments that can really transform our ability to tackle corruption.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Just as at Lough Erne, many of these agreements are quite technical, but their impact is far reaching.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "**Exposing corruption**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "First, we will expose corruption so there is nowhere to hide.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "If you don\u2019t know who owns what, you can\u2019t stop people stealing from poor countries and hiding that stolen wealth in rich ones.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "That is why it is so important that today 5 countries have agreed to create public registers of beneficial ownership and 6 more will explore similar arrangements.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "This will mean that everyone in the world will be able to see who really owns and controls each and every company in these countries.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "The EU, Iceland, UAE and most of our Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies with major financial centres have agreed to automatically exchange their entire registries of beneficial ownership information.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "This means that law enforcement agencies across the world will be able to access this data \u2013 in many cases for the first time \u2013 and use it to expose the corrupt.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Does it need to go further? Yes of course it does, but today is a good start.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "It is no good having laws against corruption, if lawyers, accountants and estate agents find ways around the law.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So that is why it is so important that at this summit a new professional services statement of support has shown an unprecedented commitment from these professions to stop the facilitation of corruption.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Again, does this go far enough? Does it need to go further? Of course it does \u2013 we need this adopted in every country, not just some countries.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Public procurement and construction have both been massive areas for corruption around the world for years.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So a range of countries including the UK will use open contracting in their government procurement, to keep public money out of corrupt hands.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And here in the UK, we want to clean up our property market and show that there is no home for the corrupt in Britain.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So all foreign companies which own properties in the UK will have to register publicly who really owns them, who really controls them \u2013 and no foreign company will be able to buy UK property or bid for central government contracts without joining this register.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "**Punish the perpetrators**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Next, we will do more to punish the perpetrators of corruption and to support those affected by it.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We know that corruption is a global phenomenon, so it\u2019s essential that we share information and pursue the corrupt across borders, joining the dots to identify and prosecute the corrupt and to seize their assets \u2013 a point that so many speakers have made today.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So the new International Anti-Corruption Co-ordination Centre we are creating will help police and prosecutors work together to do just that.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But we also need to ensure that when we expose the corrupt, we are able to seize their assets and return them to the countries from which they were stolen.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "That\u2019s why our Global Forum for Asset Recovery will be so important \u2013 enabling governments and law enforcement agencies around the world to work together to achieve this.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We have also agreed today that 22 countries will introduce new asset recovery legislation, 14 will strengthen their protections for whistle-blowers \u2013 a discussion we had in the last session and 11 countries will review the penalties for companies that fail to prevent tax evasion.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Here in Britain we will consult on extending that criminal offence of tax evasion, to other economic crimes such as fraud and money laundering, and we hope others will follow.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We want firms properly held to account for any criminal activity within them.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We are also consulting on Unexplained Wealth Orders, reversing the burden of proof so if someone is suspected of corruption, the onus is on them to prove they acquired their wealth legitimately or they will face having it stripped from them by a court.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "**Driving out corruption**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Third, we will do more to drive out corruption wherever it is found.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "This requires the political leadership we have seen today \u2013 and a sustained effort at changing cultures of corruption.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "One example of this is the twinning of different countries\u2019 tax inspectors to help build a shared culture of probity and honesty.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And today we\u2019ve seen 17 countries commit to such partnerships between their institutions and professions, and I want to thank Professor Paul Collier for his great work on this.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We have also had a very frank discussion about changing cultures in sport.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "The world loves sport \u2013 and the world knows that sport is riddled with corruption.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So only when we deal with corruption in sport will people really believe that we are dealing with corruption more broadly.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Today we have taken an important step towards an International Sport Integrity Partnership that would restore integrity to the games we love and we will be keeping up the pressure to land this at a meeting with the IOC in February.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We are also raising our own standards of governance and transparency to the highest possible levels here in the UK through the new Sports Charter.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "**Next steps**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But today\u2019s summit hasn\u2019t just been about securing these agreements.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We have also held, I think you\u2019ll agree, a different kind of event.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Instead of simply having speeches talking to ourselves about we have agreed and we have had open, honest and challenging conversations.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We have asked tough questions about the challenges in implementing these agreements and explored new ideas and next steps that can really raise the ambition further.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We have been asked whether we could enforce action against corruption in the same way that we enforce action against terrorism?\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We have been challenged to protect the freedom of the press and the whistleblowers who are so vital in helping them to expose the corrupt.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We have talked about the need for more action from multinational companies.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "There was a great challenge for anti-corruption organisations to work more closely together \u2013 to deliver a more co-ordinated effort.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We\u2019ve talked about the need for every country to ultimately reach what I call the gold standard of a having a public register of beneficial ownership.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And I am clear that I include all the Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies in that. But it was encouraging to hear praise for what the head of the OECD described as, and I quote, the \u201cexemplary delivery\u201d of our crown dependencies in the steps they have taken so far.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "Finally, we have been clear that this summit will not be a single one-off moment.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We are building a global movement against corruption.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "As President Ghani said \u2013 this cannot be a fashion \u2013 we have stay the course on this for the next 10 years and beyond.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We welcome the commitment from Japan to include this issue and the learnings of this summit in its G7 Presidency.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "We have agreed that we will meet again at the UN General Assembly next year.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And in the meantime we will continue to track the implementation of everything we have agreed today.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And let\u2019s just be clear what all these agreements really add up to.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "As I said, some of them are very technical.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "But what we are talking about is stopping the corrupt hiding their loot from the authorities.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "So as John Kerry said \u2013 there are \u201cno more safe harbours\u201d for the corrupt.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "It means that when people steal money from your country and hide it in mine \u2013 we can expose them and return the money to you.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "It means getting stolen assets returned to people like President Buhari and President Ghani, so they can be reinvested in the future of their countries.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "It means cleaning up our property market right here in London.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "It means helping to secure for all our economies some of the trillions in potential economic growth that is so needlessly lost to corruption.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "It means building an unprecedented global coalition to tackle this cancer of corruption which destroys jobs, traps the poorest in poverty and as Sarah Chayes has argued so powerfully today \u2013 even undermines our security.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "It means quite simply \u2013 winning the battle against one of the greatest enemies of progress in our time.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "And I say again, if we want to beat poverty, if we want to beat extremism and narrow the gap between the richest countries in the world and the poorest countries in the world, we have to tackle corruption.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant",
        "That is our mission. And that is the vital work that we have begun today and I want to thank everyone for their contributions.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant"
