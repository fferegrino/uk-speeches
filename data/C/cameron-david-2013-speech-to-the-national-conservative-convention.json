        "I want to start today with a very clear message for our Party.",
        "About who we are. What we\u2019re for.",
        "We are people who love our country.",
        "Who believe in Britain\u2019s greatness \u2013 and believe in restoring it.",
        "Almost three years ago we came into office at a perilous moment in our country\u2019s history.",
        "The needle on the gauge was hovering between decline or success. Sink or swim.",
        "It fell to us in this Party to serve our country in its hour of need.",
        "That is an honour. It is a privilege.",
        "And we must never forget it.",
        "We always knew we\u2019d face pretty big challenges right now.",
        "It\u2019s mid-term.",
        "We\u2019re wrestling with historic debts.",
        "Recovering from the deepest recession since records began.",
        "Fixing a broken welfare system and education system \u2013 and yes, a broken society too.",
        "Anyone who thought it was going to be easy \u2013 they\u2019re wrong.",
        "Anyone who thinks it\u2019s going to get easier \u2013 they\u2019re wrong too.",
        "But let\u2019s remember \u2013 above all the background noise \u2013 what this is all about:",
        "The national interest: first, last, always.",
        "This is a battle for Britain\u2019s future we are engaged in.",
        "So let the message go out from this hall and this party:",
        "We are here to fight.",
        "We are here to win.",
        "And we have never been more up for the task of turning our country around.",
        "Last October, at our Party conference, I set out the scale of that task.",
        "There\u2019s a global race underway\u2026",
        "\u2026and we\u2019re making sure Britain succeeds in it.",
        "Schools that are world-class.",
        "A welfare system that works.",
        "And crucially \u2013 a stronger economy.",
        "Now politicians can always talk\u2026",
        "\u2026so here, today, I want to give you a progress report.",
        "First, schools.",
        "In just the past six months we\u2019ve opened over 400 new Academies\u2026",
        "\u2026making it more than two and a half thousand opened so far.",
        "We\u2019ve got dozens more free schools in the pipeline\u2026",
        "\u2026adding to the 80 that have already opened their doors.",
        "Started from scratch; independent schools; inside the state sector.",
        "We\u2019ve announced tougher tests for trainee teachers\u2026",
        "\u2026more rigorous GCSEs\u2026",
        "\u2026a new national curriculum \u2013 and it\u2019s got proper, narrative history back at its heart: Kings, Queens, battles,dates \u2013 our island\u2019s story in all its glory.",
        "And what about welfare?",
        "We said it\u2019s wrong for people on welfare to see their incomes going up faster than people in work\u2026",
        "\u2026so last December we made the tough decision to up-rate benefits by just 1 per cent.",
        "We said we\u2019d get Britain working\u2026",
        "\u2026and unemployment has fallen again and again since the Conference.",
        "In fact today we have more people in work than ever before.",
        "On our economy, things are still tough.",
        "But remember this:",
        "The deficit \u2013 it\u2019s been cut by a quarter.",
        "Corporation tax \u2013 cut to one of the lowest rates in the G7.Private sector jobs \u2013 up by more than one million. Yes, more than one million new jobs under this Government.",
        "Up in Liverpool the docks are being renovated, creating 20,000 new jobs over the coming years.",
        "We\u2019ve got Jaguar Land Rover creating thousands of jobs in the West Midlands.",
        "Nissan creating hundreds of jobs in Sunderland.",
        "Last year we exported more cars than any other year in our history.",
        "This year it was confirmed we\u2019re now Germany\u2019s chief trading partner\u2026",
        "\u2026and you know what \u2013 we overtook France.",
        "A month ago I took a massive trade delegation to India\u2026",
        "\u2026and our exports there are up by more than half in the past three years.",
        "Our exports to China \u2013 almost doubled.",
        "To Russia \u2013 more than doubled.",
        "Friends, when Britain is getting back on her feet and back on the map\u2026\u2026it can only mean one thing\u2026",
        "\u2026the Conservatives are back in Government.",
        "And let me say this about the global race.",
        "We won\u2019t succeed unless the European Union really drives growth\u2026",
        "\u2026and I was in Brussels yet again yesterday making that argument.",
        "Let me tell you about those trips to Brussels.",
        "Since I last spoke to you at the conference in October we\u2019ve kept the rebate\u2026",
        "\u2026cut the 7-year Budget\u2026",
        "\u2026got an historic agreement to cut regulation instead of endlessly increasing it.",
        "And yes: when it comes to Europe, it is this Party that\u2019s going to negotiate a better deal for Britain\u2026",
        "\u2026and this Party that is finally going to give the British people their say.",
        "This is what Conservatives do.",
        "We make Britain stand tall and proud again.",
        "And for us, this global race is not just about GDP.",
        "It\u2019s about saying to the mum who\u2019s worried about her children\u2019s future\u2026",
        "\u2026we are building a country where there is a future\u2026",
        "\u2026so your kids won\u2019t have to get on a plane to get on in life, they can make it right here in Britain.",
        "It\u2019s what this party\u2019s always been about \u2013 aspiration.",
        "Helping those who really do want to work hard; and get on; and make a better life for their family.",
        "And here, friends, is a big difference between us and the Labour party.",
        "Labour say they\u2019re on the side of the little guys\u2026",
        "\u2026but the point is this\u2026",
        "\u2026in their vision the little guys stay little.",
        "We\u2019re about helping people stand taller. Reach further. Do better. Not patronising people, patting them on the head and putting a benefit cheque in their hands\u2026",
        "\u2026but looking them in the eye as equals\u2026",
        "\u2026knowing that nine times out of ten if you give people the tools \u2013 the stability at home, the rigour at school, the opportunity at work \u2013 they will finish the job and write their own success story.",
        "And that is the crucial point. We give people the tools to succeed. Yes, we believe self-reliance is a good thing, but that doesn\u2019t mean \u201cyou\u2019re on your own\u201d.You can\u2019t just say to the teenager who no one has ever believed in: \u201cpull yourself up by the boot-straps\u201d.",
        "I know the leg-ups I got in life.",
        "A loving family, wonderful parents, a great school and university.",
        "Aspiration needs to be nurtured.",
        "And this party has always understood that.",
        "We want people to climb up through their own efforts, yes\u2026",
        "\u2026but in order to climb up they need the ladder to be there in the first place\u2026",
        "\u2026the family that nurtures them, the school that inspires them, the opportunities there for them.",
        "Great Conservatives down the generations have put those ladders in place.",
        "When Churchill invented the labour exchanges that helped people into work.",
        "When Macmillan built new homes.",
        "When Thatcher fired up enterprise so people could start their own businesses.",
        "That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in the Conservative Party right now.",
        "And here, today, I want to focus on what we\u2019re doing for our young people.",
        "There are far too many people in their teens and twenties who are right at the start of their lives \u2013 but can feel it\u2019s the end of the line.",
        "No one\u2019s believed in them.",
        "No one\u2019s given them a chance.",
        "That\u2019s what I\u2019m determined to change.",
        "We are building an aspiration nation.",
        "A country where it\u2019s not who you know or where you\u2019re from\u2026",
        "\u2026but who you are and where you\u2019re determined to go. My dream for Britain is that opportunity is not an accident of birth, but a birth-right.",
        "Like Churchill said: \u201cwe are for the ladder. Let all try their best to climb\u201d.",
        "So let me tell you about the ladder we are building for our young people today.",
        "The very first rung \u2013 of course \u2013 is a loving family\u2026",
        "\u2026and that\u2019s why we must start with those who have no family \u2013 who start their lives in care.",
        "Just listen to this.",
        "Around a quarter of the people in our prisons were in care as children.",
        "And the real tragedy is that so many of these stories could have been avoided.",
        "There were people desperate to give children a loving home, but the system said \u2018no\u2019.",
        "It takes on average almost two years for a child to move into a loving home\u2026",
        "\u2026and do you know what, black children can typically wait a year longer.",
        "Time and again the system said you need the perfect \u2018ethnic match\u2019.",
        "That is wrong and we\u2019re changing it.",
        "We\u2019re making it clear to everyone working in our adoption system: we must move faster \u2013 and what matters is not the colour of a family\u2019s skin, it\u2019s the love that\u2019s in it.",
        "The next rung on the ladder is a decent education.",
        "Most of us parents are the same.",
        "We want our children to learn the basics \u2013 and then to see their unique talents nurtured.",
        "For me it\u2019s one of the big joys of being a Dad\u2026",
        "\u2026seeing something your children are good at\u2026",
        "\u2026sometimes wondering \u201cwhere on earth did they get that from?\u201d\u2026",
        "\u2026but then thinking where they\u2019ll go with it.",
        "I say it loud and proud: Samantha and I are pushy parents.",
        "And I want the education system in this country to be like the pushiest, most sharp-elbowed, ambitious parent there is.",
        "Because for years we had the opposite.",
        "We had a left-wing establishment that had bargain-basement expectations of millions of children. They dumbed down the qualifications.",
        "They turned their face away from sinking, failing and coasting schools.",
        "They said: \u201cwell, some kids from some estates were never going to do that well anyway, so let\u2019s just stick them on soft courses rather than challenge them.\u201d",
        "You know \u2013 those so-called progressives did more to stunt progress and opportunity than almost anyone else in our country.",
        "And it makes me angry.",
        "It makes me angry when I think of children the same age as mine just being marked down and written off\u2026",
        "\u2026no-one noticing their talents or doing anything to nurture them\u2026",
        "\u2026what a complete and utter waste of potential in our country.",
        "So where they broke those rungs on the ladder of aspiration \u2013 we are fixing them.",
        "Where they said\u2026",
        "\u2026\u201call must have prizes\u201d\u2026",
        "\u2026primary school children should take calculators into maths tests\u2026",
        "\u2026grammar and spelling \u2013 well they don\u2019t matter\u2026",
        "\u2026after all: it\u2019s elitist and old-fashioned to care about these things\u2026",
        "\u2026we have said: you\u2019re wrong and it\u2019s time to wake up.",
        "Our children can\u2019t compete in this world without a real education.",
        "So we\u2019re getting calculators out of those maths tests\u2026",
        "\u2026and we\u2019re saying spelling, grammar and punctuation \u2013 they do matter and children should be marked on them too.",
        "Instead of dumbing down, we\u2019re sharpening up.",
        "Instead of saying: things like single sciences are too tough for kids to study\u2026",
        "\u2026we say: we can\u2019t ask our children to reach for the stars unless they know why they\u2019re there in the first place\u2026",
        "\u2026and today, for the first time in a long time, the number of young people studying science at GCSE \u2013 it\u2019s going up. And you know what else the left-wing establishment didn\u2019t like?",
        "Competitive sports \u2013 because there are winners and losers.",
        "We say: sport forms character; builds team-work; helps children to succeed.",
        "Yes, you win some; you lose some \u2013 and you\u2019ve got to learn that.",
        "Now for years Government thought you could just set a target for sport and that would fix the problem.",
        "But it doesn\u2019t work like that. One of the reasons why private schools do so brilliantly with sport isn\u2019t targets \u2013 it\u2019s that they have teachers there who love to teach sport.",
        "The fact is you can make all these speeches you want and set all the targets you like; but if you want sport taught \u2013 you\u2019ve got to employ teachers who do just that.",
        "So I am proud to announce today that this government is going to fund more sports teaching in our primary schools\u2026",
        "\u2026the equivalent of 2 days a week of teaching for every school\u2026",
        "\u2026\u00a3150 million of extra funding.",
        "And that money has to be spent on sport. Nothing else.",
        "We all know how we felt watching those Olympics and Paralympics.",
        "Cheering our hearts out for Jess Ennis and David Weir.",
        "This is about making sure that legacy really means something\u2026",
        "\u2026so the next Mo Farah won\u2019t be stuck at home on the sofa, they\u2019ll be competing for Team GB.",
        "The next rung on the ladder is education after school.",
        "Is it any wonder some of our young people were left confused.",
        "18 year-olds were told: \u201cGo to university, it\u2019s the ticket to success\u201d\u2026",
        "\u2026then they heard: \u201coh, but you know they\u2019re all mickey mouse courses these days\u201d.",
        "Then it was: \u201cwhat businesses actually want is real skills\u201d\u2026",
        "\u2026but they looked at doing something vocational and found this alphabet soup of qualifications, many of which were worthless.",
        "That is the hopeless situation Labour left.",
        "So we\u2019re sweeping that confusion away \u2013 and have this clear ambition:",
        "We want it to be the new norm in our country that at the age of 18, every school leaver either starts an Apprenticeship or goes to university.",
        "Two clear paths. Both highly respected.",
        "If you think this can\u2019t happen, look at Germany.",
        "Their universities are good. Their apprenticeships are excellent.",
        "And they have one of the lowest rates of youth unemployment in Europe.",
        "We can have the same here.",
        "Already we\u2019ve reformed university funding.",
        "Why? Because I\u2019m determined that we go on being able to afford world-class universities.",
        "And to the students: you don\u2019t pay a penny of those fees back until you\u2019re earning \u00a321,000. Not one penny.",
        "And you know what?",
        "Since the new system came in, in spite of all the warnings, applications haven\u2019t gone down \u2013 they\u2019re going up\u2026",
        "\u2026and the application rate for the poorest students is at its highest level ever.",
        "We\u2019re making big changes to apprenticeships too.",
        "We\u2019ve started new Higher Apprenticeships\u2026",
        "\u2026designed by companies like Rolls Royce and Siemens\u2026",
        "\u2026every bit the equal of the best degrees.",
        "And remember: over a million apprenticeships have been started since we came to office.",
        "This is how we back the aspirations of young people \u2013 and help them to win in the global race.",
        "The next rung on that ladder for young people is work: a decent job for decent pay.",
        "Think of the young woman who has slogged her way through college, sitting at her parents\u2019 kitchen table, writing out application form after application form because she\u2019s desperate for a decent job.",
        "Now what do we say to people like her?",
        "Labour say: We need more spending, more borrowing, more debt \u2013 and everything will be fine.",
        "When will they learn?",
        "You can\u2019t borrow your way out of a debt crisis.",
        "We say that the old economy they left us was built on debt and spending and out-of-control immigration.",
        "It didn\u2019t work for Britain \u2013 and it didn\u2019t work for young people.",
        "Never let them forget \u2013 youth unemployment went up by 40 per cent under Labour.",
        "So we have a new approach.",
        "Instead of welfare that pays people to sit at home instead of go to work\u2026",
        "\u2026we\u2019ve done things like introduce real work experience to get you off the dole and into a job.",
        "Instead of out-of-control immigration \u2013 we\u2019ve got a grip on it.",
        "Instead of training schemes that just sent people through the revolving door from benefits, to a job for a bit, and then back onto benefits again\u2026",
        "\u2026we\u2019ve got a Work Programme which pays out when people get into long-term work, not some quick fix.",
        "And we\u2019re seeing results. The number on out-of-work benefits \u2013 it\u2019s down.",
        "Net migration \u2013 it\u2019s been cut by a third.",
        "Under Labour, in those so-called boom years, over half of new jobs went to foreign nationals\u2026",
        "\u2026with this Government that\u2019s been cut to just ten per cent in the last year.",
        "And we had a record set last year too: more private sector firms in existence than any other year in our history.",
        "We\u2019re backing that with Start-Up Loans.",
        "If you\u2019re 30 or under and you\u2019ve got a business idea you can apply for a few thousand pounds to get it going \u2013 and then you pay it back at a decent interest rate.",
        "I launched these last year and they\u2019re running at hundreds of new loans a week.",
        "We\u2019re not offering young people a false promise, but giving them a real future: a country where if they work hard they can get on in life.",
        "And friends, for most young people, getting on in life means one more thing: a home of their own.",
        "Now some people say, after the boom and bust of recent years, is this still realistic? Shouldn\u2019t we get used to the more continental style of renting our homes?",
        "The people who say this often do so from the comfort of the flat or house they bought when prices were low.",
        "Well I remember getting the keys to my first flat, and walking through the door and having that great feeling of owning your own place\u2026",
        "\u2026and I know that for young people in our country the dream of home ownership never dies.",
        "And it\u2019s not just young people.",
        "Let me read you a letter I got recently from a woman in West Sussex.",
        "She says: My mother has lived in the same house for 37 years and it has always been her dream to buy it.",
        "This year we completed the purchase of our home thanks to the council discount being increased\u2026 with the new discount we made the purchase effortlessly.",
        "She ends the letter: \u201cwe are now proud home owners\u201d.",
        "That\u2019s something this Government made possible.",
        "And I\u2019m determined we do more.",
        "Where councils aren\u2019t doing enough to let people buy their own homes \u2013 we\u2019re getting after them.",
        "Where young people are finding it tough to raise a deposit \u2013 we\u2019re helping them.",
        "Where builders have land but can\u2019t get finance \u2013 we\u2019re getting those loans to them.",
        "Where government-owned land could be released for new homes \u2013 we\u2019re making it happen.",
