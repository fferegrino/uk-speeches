        "It is an honour to be speaking here this evening, on this most sombre and important of days.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "It\u2019s not only my privilege to represent Her Majesty\u2019s government.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "The government wishes, of course, to pay its respects to those whom we honour this evening, such as the 10 British prisoners of war who saved Hannah Sarah Rigler from the Danzig death march.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",

        "It\u2019s not just that bystanders look away; it\u2019s that they choose to look away. The soil of hatred is fertilised by indifference to wickedness.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
        "That starts with tolerating small acts of hatred, such as casual stereotyping; only if _\u201ceveryday evil\u201d_ remains unchecked can wickedness take root, and grow, into the acts which blight humanity.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals",
