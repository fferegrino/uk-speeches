        "Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Let me say that there was considerable press interest in our Committee\u2019s work, and I decided that we should send a copy of the report to the Speaker. I thought that time might be set aside for a debate about referring it to the Committee of Privileges. However, the Speaker wrote back to me saying that he did not believe the case met the threshold for a debate. I recorded a video summarising the Speaker\u2019s decision, and I tweeted it. I offered no comment about the Speaker, nor did I criticise him. There was considerable public interest, and I soon discovered that the Speaker was angry. He believed that I should not have reported his decision. Last Wednesday, he told me in the House that he thought I had not summarised him accurately, and that I should not have reported him at all. It was not my intention in any way to summarise him inaccurately.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: United Nations Climate Change Conference (Conference of Parties)\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education\n  *[ODA]: Official Development Assistance\n  *[NGOs]: non-governmental organisations\n  *[NGO]: non-governmental organisation\n  *[BII]: British Investment International\n  *[DFID]: Department for International Development\n  *[UKEF]: UK Export Finance\n  *[COPs]: *[COP]: United Nations Climate Change Conferences\n  *[UNGA]: United Nations General Assembly\n  *[IDA]: International Development Association\n  *[IBRD]: International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n  *[IFC]: International Finance Corporation\n  *[IDA20]: World Bank launched an early twentieth replenishment process of the International Development Association\n  *[SDG]: Sustainable Development Goal\n  *[GRF]: Global Refugee Forum\n  *[SAF]: Sudanese Armed Forces\n  *[RSF]: Rapid Support Forces\n  *[EBacc]: English Baccalaureate",
        "Before I was elected to the House, I was a journalist\u2014a reporter for \u201cNewsnight\u201d, among other current affairs shows. I believe in open democracy, but I also believe in maintaining agreed confidentiality. It did not cross my mind that revealing the Speaker\u2019s decision on this was a breach of privilege. After all, what was I to say if journalists asked me whether I had written to the Speaker? Was I to say, \u201cYes\u201d? If they asked me, \u201cHas the Speaker responded? Has the Speaker given a ruling?\u201d, was I then to say, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t tell you\u201d? I did not consider that I had broken any confidence or betrayed any trust. I did not imagine that the Speaker\u2019s decision on a matter of importance to my constituents could not be revealed. Moreover, I believe that I summarised the Speaker fairly, but I am in the unfortunate position of finding myself unable to prove that, because in order to do so I would have to release the Speaker\u2019s letter to me in its entirety\u2014something which, as we have established, the Speaker does not believe I should do.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: United Nations Climate Change Conference (Conference of Parties)\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education\n  *[ODA]: Official Development Assistance\n  *[NGOs]: non-governmental organisations\n  *[NGO]: non-governmental organisation\n  *[BII]: British Investment International\n  *[DFID]: Department for International Development\n  *[UKEF]: UK Export Finance\n  *[COPs]: *[COP]: United Nations Climate Change Conferences\n  *[UNGA]: United Nations General Assembly\n  *[IDA]: International Development Association\n  *[IBRD]: International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n  *[IFC]: International Finance Corporation\n  *[IDA20]: World Bank launched an early twentieth replenishment process of the International Development Association\n  *[SDG]: Sustainable Development Goal\n  *[GRF]: Global Refugee Forum\n  *[SAF]: Sudanese Armed Forces\n  *[RSF]: Rapid Support Forces\n  *[EBacc]: English Baccalaureate",
        "There has been a suggestion that I printed only half the letter. That is not the case. The Speaker\u2019s letter to me came as a letter through the post. There was no need for me to print it, nor did I publish it, nor did I show its contents to the camera, nor did I leak it to others. I was very open in the way I talked about it, which I hope shows that I did not think I was behaving improperly. There has also been some suggestion that the Select Committee did not wish to see this matter proceed to a privileges debate. That, too, is not the case.

Indeed\u2014this is perhaps not a matter for today\u2014should there not be a distinction between correspondence containing confidences and correspondence on policy decisions?

Those who know me will know that I do not ever conduct politics in a way that aims to be offensive, and I am truly sorry that the Speaker is upset. I am truly sorry that I have upset the Speaker, but it would be disingenuous of me to say that I knowingly revealed this. I could not have been more open by going on camera and discussing this. I clearly was not trying to hide it.
