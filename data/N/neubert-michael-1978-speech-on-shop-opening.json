The statutes which it superseded dated back to the period 1912 to 1938.

        "These differing interpretations of the scope of their discretion by different local authorities lead to inequity and inequality of opportunity. As an illustration, one company in my constituency\u2014which is a major Vauxhall dealer in East London\u2014is able to hold after-hours promotions in its showrooms in other parts of the area but not in Romford.

        "My Bill would, therefore, regularise the position by allowing local authorities the discretion to approve the holding of a limited number of specific promotional functions on individual retail premises, after hours, on weekday evenings only. This small amendment to confirm existing \u200b practice would not conflict with the principal purposes of the Act in respect of closing hours which were to safeguard employees from exploitation and to protect traders from unfair competition, since such events would be infrequent, subject to approval by the local authority and the opportunity open to all traders on application.
