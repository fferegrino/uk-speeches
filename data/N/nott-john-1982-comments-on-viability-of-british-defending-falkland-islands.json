        "If Argentinian naval vessels comes into the 200-mile zone we will shoot first. It will be a judgement on their part, whether they want to risk coming into the zone. You\u2019ll see. We wouldn\u2019t start a battle we couldn\u2019t win and I am confident that even though we are 8,000 miles away we have made arrangements for all the logistic support that we need for the fleet and the supporting arms, and that we can sustain it for a very long period of time.
