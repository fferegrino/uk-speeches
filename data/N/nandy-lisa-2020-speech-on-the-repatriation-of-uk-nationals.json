        "I am deeply concerned that, weeks after Britons were advised to return home by the Government, there is still no accurate assessment of who is stranded and where. On Monday, the Foreign Office came up with a figure of 57,500, yet I have been told repeatedly that there can be no accurate assessment because, although some embassies record those who approach them for help, others do not. We do need to know who is stranded and where, so will the Minister now ensure that his Department now counts and publishes those statistics, so that we can bring those numbers down rapidly?\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: United Nations Climate Change Conference (Conference of Parties)\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education\n  *[ODA]: Official Development Assistance\n  *[NGOs]: non-governmental organisations\n  *[NGO]: non-governmental organisation\n  *[BII]: British Investment International\n  *[DFID]: Department for International Development\n  *[UKEF]: UK Export Finance\n  *[COPs]: *[COP]: United Nations Climate Change Conferences\n  *[UNGA]: United Nations General Assembly\n  *[IDA]: International Development Association\n  *[IBRD]: International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n  *[IFC]: International Finance Corporation\n  *[IDA20]: World Bank launched an early twentieth replenishment process of the International Development Association\n  *[SDG]: Sustainable Development Goal\n  *[GRF]: Global Refugee Forum\n  *[SAF]: Sudanese Armed Forces\n  *[RSF]: Rapid Support Forces\n  *[EBacc]: English Baccalaureate",
        "I was glad to hear that the numbers returned on charter flights are up to 19,000, on 93 flights, and I again place on the record my thanks to our diplomats, embassies and consular staff, but this is still frustratingly slow by comparison with countries such as Germany, which by early April had repatriated 60,000 citizens on 240 charter flights. By chartering 20 times the number of flights, Germany was able to bring its citizens home weeks ago\u2014I place on the record my thanks to Germany and other countries that offered spare places on their flights to stranded Britons\u2014and I am sure the Minister understands why people are upset and frustrated that their Government have not done the same.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: United Nations Climate Change Conference (Conference of Parties)\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education\n  *[ODA]: Official Development Assistance\n  *[NGOs]: non-governmental organisations\n  *[NGO]: non-governmental organisation\n  *[BII]: British Investment International\n  *[DFID]: Department for International Development\n  *[UKEF]: UK Export Finance\n  *[COPs]: *[COP]: United Nations Climate Change Conferences\n  *[UNGA]: United Nations General Assembly\n  *[IDA]: International Development Association\n  *[IBRD]: International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n  *[IFC]: International Finance Corporation\n  *[IDA20]: World Bank launched an early twentieth replenishment process of the International Development Association\n  *[SDG]: Sustainable Development Goal\n  *[GRF]: Global Refugee Forum\n  *[SAF]: Sudanese Armed Forces\n  *[RSF]: Rapid Support Forces\n  *[EBacc]: English Baccalaureate",
        "I know that the Government were keen to reduce costs, but this reliance on commercial flights has left far too many British people at the mercy of cancelled flights, airline strikes, extortionate prices, domestic lockdowns and chaotic booking systems, so can the \u200bMinister commit today to rapidly scaling up the number of charter flights? It is not clear to me what the barrier still is. Ninety per cent. of the country\u2019s commercial fleet is grounded. The RAF stands ready to help. Other countries have the same problems as we do, and in recent weeks I have spoken to many global leaders who say that there is a willingness to work together internationally to open airspace and to keep the transit hubs operating. He is doing his best, but this is unlike the problems that the Government have had with testing or PPE; we have the capacity to do more, and we must.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: United Nations Climate Change Conference (Conference of Parties)\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education\n  *[ODA]: Official Development Assistance\n  *[NGOs]: non-governmental organisations\n  *[NGO]: non-governmental organisation\n  *[BII]: British Investment International\n  *[DFID]: Department for International Development\n  *[UKEF]: UK Export Finance\n  *[COPs]: *[COP]: United Nations Climate Change Conferences\n  *[UNGA]: United Nations General Assembly\n  *[IDA]: International Development Association\n  *[IBRD]: International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n  *[IFC]: International Finance Corporation\n  *[IDA20]: World Bank launched an early twentieth replenishment process of the International Development Association\n  *[SDG]: Sustainable Development Goal\n  *[GRF]: Global Refugee Forum\n  *[SAF]: Sudanese Armed Forces\n  *[RSF]: Rapid Support Forces\n  *[EBacc]: English Baccalaureate",
        "Many people on those charter flights told me that they are being charged up to \u00a31,000 a ticket, so it would be helpful to understand where the \u00a375 million that the Foreign Secretary announced has gone. Has it been spent and, if so, what on? After the Foreign Office website this week suggested that Britons in New Zealand might be better off staying put until the crisis is over, can the Minister commit that all British people who need it will be not just helped, as he suggested, but repatriated, and that the cost will be no barrier to bringing our citizens home?\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: United Nations Climate Change Conference (Conference of Parties)\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education\n  *[ODA]: Official Development Assistance\n  *[NGOs]: non-governmental organisations\n  *[NGO]: non-governmental organisation\n  *[BII]: British Investment International\n  *[DFID]: Department for International Development\n  *[UKEF]: UK Export Finance\n  *[COPs]: *[COP]: United Nations Climate Change Conferences\n  *[UNGA]: United Nations General Assembly\n  *[IDA]: International Development Association\n  *[IBRD]: International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n  *[IFC]: International Finance Corporation\n  *[IDA20]: World Bank launched an early twentieth replenishment process of the International Development Association\n  *[SDG]: Sustainable Development Goal\n  *[GRF]: Global Refugee Forum\n  *[SAF]: Sudanese Armed Forces\n  *[RSF]: Rapid Support Forces\n  *[EBacc]: English Baccalaureate",

        "Finally, I would like to ask the Minister about the mixed messages that those returning home are getting. At the weekend, a Government source told The Telegraph that a 14-day quarantine period would be introduced. When the Foreign Secretary was asked, he simply said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Yesterday, the Transport Secretary wrote to MPs to tell us that targeted screening measures had been carried out at UK airports but that those have now been stopped. That is really worrying. There are people entering the UK from countries where infection rates are rising, access to healthcare is limited and preventive measures are non-existent. They are travelling back to their families on public transport.

        "We have discussed that several times. It is frustratingly one of the areas where we have been unable to make progress, and the UK is now a major outlier on this. South Korea, the Netherlands, Greece, Lithuania and Singapore all have self-isolation requirements in place. We must have clear advice for those returning to the UK, with a quarantine period and testing on return to limit the spread of the virus. Can the Minister commit to that today, and if he cannot, will he take it away and ensure that it is acted on? As always, I am ready, happy and willing to offer assistance and support where I can.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: United Nations Climate Change Conference (Conference of Parties)\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education\n  *[ODA]: Official Development Assistance\n  *[NGOs]: non-governmental organisations\n  *[NGO]: non-governmental organisation\n  *[BII]: British Investment International\n  *[DFID]: Department for International Development\n  *[UKEF]: UK Export Finance\n  *[COPs]: *[COP]: United Nations Climate Change Conferences\n  *[UNGA]: United Nations General Assembly\n  *[IDA]: International Development Association\n  *[IBRD]: International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n  *[IFC]: International Finance Corporation\n  *[IDA20]: World Bank launched an early twentieth replenishment process of the International Development Association\n  *[SDG]: Sustainable Development Goal\n  *[GRF]: Global Refugee Forum\n  *[SAF]: Sudanese Armed Forces\n  *[RSF]: Rapid Support Forces\n  *[EBacc]: English Baccalaureate"
