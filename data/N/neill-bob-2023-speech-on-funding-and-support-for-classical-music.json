It is precisely because of that connection that I have seen at first hand the effect that the cuts imposed by Arts Council England have had on people who are dedicated professionals and who contribute to the economy of this country in a significant manner. We should not forget the value of classical music to the arts offer of this country, but it also makes a massive change in enriching lives\u2014be it teachers in schools enriching the lives of children\u2014and in enriching communities through community choirs and concerts such as the Bromley festival of speech and music, of which I have the honour to be joint president with my wife, bringing folk together and using music to pull them together.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: United Nations Climate Change Conference (Conference of Parties)\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education\n  *[ODA]: Official Development Assistance\n  *[NGOs]: non-governmental organisations\n  *[NGO]: non-governmental organisation\n  *[BII]: British Investment International\n  *[DFID]: Department for International Development\n  *[UKEF]: UK Export Finance\n  *[COPs]: *[COP]: United Nations Climate Change Conferences\n  *[UNGA]: United Nations General Assembly\n  *[IDA]: International Development Association\n  *[IBRD]: International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n  *[IFC]: International Finance Corporation\n  *[IDA20]: World Bank launched an early twentieth replenishment process of the International Development Association\n  *[SDG]: Sustainable Development Goal\n  *[GRF]: Global Refugee Forum\n  *[SAF]: Sudanese Armed Forces\n  *[RSF]: Rapid Support Forces\n  *[EBacc]: English Baccalaureate",

It has a more diverse audience and a more diverse workforce than any other company. It is much more user-friendly, if I can put it that way, to those who have not had an experience in classical music and the arts to get into. I have been to recent productions at the ENO. It has a much younger, more diverse and enthusiastic audience than might be seen in many other houses.

        "We have the perverse situation of the director of music, heaven forbid, for Arts Council England claiming that she did not believe there is any longer an audience for \u201cgrand opera\u201d, whatever she meant by that.

It is not putting on La Boh\u00e8me, Carmen or Akhnaten, a modern opera by Philip Glass that is sold out at the ENO.

        "The behaviour of Arts Council England has left Ministers exposed to criticism, because although it is an arms-length body, ultimately the blame will fall on Government. It also demonstrates that there are serious questions about its current viability as the guardians of arts in England. Its mission statement, when it was created, was to spread excellence in the arts throughout the country and to make excellence more accessible. As I pointed out earlier, and as the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate rightly said, its decisions have actually been the reverse. The former Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Member for Mid Bedfordshire (Ms Dorries), condemned the way Arts Council England carried out her ministerial instruction. Ministers can give strategic instruction to Arts Council England, although, of course, they do not get involved in individual funding decisions. I say to my hon. Friend the Minister: that which is instructed can also be uninstructed. There is no doubt that Ministers can set the tone in the way in which Arts Council England supports things.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: United Nations Climate Change Conference (Conference of Parties)\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education\n  *[ODA]: Official Development Assistance\n  *[NGOs]: non-governmental organisations\n  *[NGO]: non-governmental organisation\n  *[BII]: British Investment International\n  *[DFID]: Department for International Development\n  *[UKEF]: UK Export Finance\n  *[COPs]: *[COP]: United Nations Climate Change Conferences\n  *[UNGA]: United Nations General Assembly\n  *[IDA]: International Development Association\n  *[IBRD]: International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n  *[IFC]: International Finance Corporation\n  *[IDA20]: World Bank launched an early twentieth replenishment process of the International Development Association\n  *[SDG]: Sustainable Development Goal\n  *[GRF]: Global Refugee Forum\n  *[SAF]: Sudanese Armed Forces\n  *[RSF]: Rapid Support Forces\n  *[EBacc]: English Baccalaureate",

It is bizarre that some of my friends in the corporate world\u2014my corporate lawyer friends, dare I say it?\u2014will be able to pay the prices to go to the Glyndebourne festival, where there is no cost to the public purse, but the public funding that enabled Glyndebourne to go out to non-traditional audiences in places such as the Marlowe Theatre in Canterbury, or to Northampton or to Norwich, is the very thing that has been cut.

        "Secondly, Arts Council England itself needs a review. It is due for a departmental review before too long anyway, as it is some time since its last one.

The information available would never pass muster in a local authority or health service trust, for example. That must change and the review should look at that, as it should at the composition of the board and the recruitment of its executive team.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: United Nations Climate Change Conference (Conference of Parties)\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education\n  *[ODA]: Official Development Assistance\n  *[NGOs]: non-governmental organisations\n  *[NGO]: non-governmental organisation\n  *[BII]: British Investment International\n  *[DFID]: Department for International Development\n  *[UKEF]: UK Export Finance\n  *[COPs]: *[COP]: United Nations Climate Change Conferences\n  *[UNGA]: United Nations General Assembly\n  *[IDA]: International Development Association\n  *[IBRD]: International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n  *[IFC]: International Finance Corporation\n  *[IDA20]: World Bank launched an early twentieth replenishment process of the International Development Association\n  *[SDG]: Sustainable Development Goal\n  *[GRF]: Global Refugee Forum\n  *[SAF]: Sudanese Armed Forces\n  *[RSF]: Rapid Support Forces\n  *[EBacc]: English Baccalaureate",
        "Thirdly, if I might return to a separate matter, touring visas have been a real problem for many people. Now that we are in a much better position with the Windsor agreement and a better relationship with the European Union, there is the suggestion, which has been signed off as being entirely consistent with the trade and co-operation agreement by Sarah Lee KC, that we could have a bespoke visa-waiver agreement with the EU for touring artists for up to 90 days in a period of 180 days. That would be doable and we would not have to reopen the TCA. With the better atmosphere that the Prime Minister has now created, that would be a practical way forward.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: United Nations Climate Change Conference (Conference of Parties)\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education\n  *[ODA]: Official Development Assistance\n  *[NGOs]: non-governmental organisations\n  *[NGO]: non-governmental organisation\n  *[BII]: British Investment International\n  *[DFID]: Department for International Development\n  *[UKEF]: UK Export Finance\n  *[COPs]: *[COP]: United Nations Climate Change Conferences\n  *[UNGA]: United Nations General Assembly\n  *[IDA]: International Development Association\n  *[IBRD]: International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n  *[IFC]: International Finance Corporation\n  *[IDA20]: World Bank launched an early twentieth replenishment process of the International Development Association\n  *[SDG]: Sustainable Development Goal\n  *[GRF]: Global Refugee Forum\n  *[SAF]: Sudanese Armed Forces\n  *[RSF]: Rapid Support Forces\n  *[EBacc]: English Baccalaureate",
