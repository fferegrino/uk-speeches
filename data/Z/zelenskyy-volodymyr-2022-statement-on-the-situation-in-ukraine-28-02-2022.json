        "Good morning, Ukrainian heroes! The fifth day of Russia\u2019s full-scale war against the people of Ukraine. We stand firm. During this time, we have experienced as much as other nations may not have in decades. We have been told for a long time that there is something wrong with Ukrainians in this or that issue. That Ukrainians have to do so-called \u201chomework\u201d for decades. Because of this, we often did not notice what we are really capable of. And now we have shown ourselves to the fullest. And it\u2019s inspiring.
