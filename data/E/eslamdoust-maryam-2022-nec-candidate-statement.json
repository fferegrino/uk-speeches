        "I\u2019ve been a Labour activist for 15 years and councillor in Camden for 12 years, leading campaigns against betting shops and strip clubs taking over high streets, and currently mounting opposition to increasing numbers of school expulsions affecting our most vulnerable children.  \nAs a BAME woman I\u2019ve suffered racism throughout my life, so I know from direct personal experience that we must eradicate all forms of discrimination in our Party. I\u2019m a lifelong equalities advocate and have used my voice as a councillor to speak up for those experiencing racism, disability discrimination and to fight for women\u2019s safety.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",

        "I have campaigned for Labour in every election and under every leader since 2008. The Tories are failing Britain, but it\u2019s not good enough for us to think we can just coast into power. We need to offer socialist policies which give hope to voters and inspire Labour members and our affiliated trade unions.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
