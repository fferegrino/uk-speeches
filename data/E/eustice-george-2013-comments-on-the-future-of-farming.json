        "Agriculture is one of the most vital and rewarding careers on offer today. From food production to science and engineering there is a wealth of opportunity for young people across the sector. Whilst providing us all with the food we eat, farming is also a crucial part of our economy, contributing \u00a39 billion and 450 thousand jobs. We need to make it a more attractive career choice for talented, entrepreneurial young people so it can continue to thrive in the future.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
