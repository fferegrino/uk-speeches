Well I won\u2019t be attempting anything as brilliant or as loud as the Pretenders produced then because I\u2019ve forgotten to bring my guitar.

Bessie was the MP for Liverpool Exchange for 24 years and the first woman to represent Liverpool in Parliament. She was a passionate campaigner who did much to rid Liverpool of its slums.
