    "content": [
        "Thank you, Mr Speaker, for allowing us to sit late tonight. Bosworth has an affinity and eternal history with the monarchy. We had the battle of Bosworth in August 1485, which saw the death of Richard III and the crowning of Henry VII, so my constituency has a palpable, visible history with the monarchy, which is still there and proud today.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",

        "As Members of Parliament, we have the honour of representing and reflecting the opinions and feelings of our constituents, and something that had never before happened, in over 1,000 years of monarchy, is the ability to feel that immediately because of social media\u2014the chance for us to reflect the feelings of the nation. I have been struck by a poem that has been sent to me by several constituents and many councillors\u2014I am sure that it will have graced the screens of other hon. Members, too. I would like to read it, because it is visceral and encapsulates the feelings of the nation:\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
