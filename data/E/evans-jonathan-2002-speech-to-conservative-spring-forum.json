        "This afternoon we are going to discuss the international situation. There is no more important issue.

        "The horror of September 11th, the liberation of Afghanistan, the menacing threat from Iraq \u2013 these events have brought into sharp focus the challenges we face. Challenges underlined by further terrorist murders this week in Israel, Peru, Spain and Italy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "It is a poisonous cocktail. Ruthlessly organised, fanatically motivated terrorists, keen to inflict mass bloodshed on innocent citizens. Rogue states developing weapons of mass destruction, who regard the West as their enemy, and see these terror networks as useful tools.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",

        "We are arguing for strong defences, for NATO rather than a European army, for taking a stand for what we all know to be right.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",

        "In Europe, Labour\u2019s priority is not a Europe of nation states backing the America \u2013 but the familiar narrow agenda of building continental socialism.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "That\u2019s why Labour always vote for new burdens on business, for rigid labour markets, for harmonised taxes \u2013 and for changes in Europe\u2019s rules that would weaken our right to sometimes simply say no.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "And the LibDems are no better: in fact, they are even worse.

        "Labour\u2019s longest-serving MEP walked away from his party, crossed the floor and joined us. Richard Balfe, London\u2019s Labour representative in Europe for 20 years, became our 36th Conservative MEP \u2013 the first switch of a serving parliamentarian to the Conservative Party in a quarter of a century.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "Why?
