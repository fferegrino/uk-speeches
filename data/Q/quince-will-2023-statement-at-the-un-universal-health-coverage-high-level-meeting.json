        "No matter where in the world they\u2019re born, everyone has a right to affordable, quality health care.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But every year, seeking health care pushes hundreds of millions of people into poverty. And millions more can\u2019t get the care they deserve.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We cannot let this continue. We can do better.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That\u2019s why today, we must reinvigorate our mission to achieve universal health coverage.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The UK proposes three key priorities.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "First, we must focus our efforts on a primary health care approach.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The UK is committed to doing this by building global partnerships.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This includes working with like minded nations to champion sexual and reproductive health and rights as part of universal health coverage. And rolling out life-changing vaccines, medicines, and technology in communities.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This week, we pledged up to \u00a3295 million for global research partnerships.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "These partnerships will help forge the tools and evidence we need to make universal health coverage a reality. As well as addressing other key priorities like ending the preventable deaths of mothers, babies and children, strengthening global health security, and tackling antimicrobial resistance.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Second, we must combat financial hardship.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This means Governments protecting the poorest in our societies from devastating health care fees.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We recognise many countries face serious financial challenges, limiting their ability to do this.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That\u2019s why the UK is championing reforms to the international financial system to help developing countries access more finance to address their priorities. And achieving universal coverage must be at the heart of this work.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Third, we must strengthen the global workforce, the lifeblood of our health systems.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "By 2030, there could be a global shortfall of ten million health workers. So, we must join forces to train, recruit, and retain more of these vital public servants.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That\u2019s why this year, we launched the first-ever long-term workforce plan for the NHS. And announced a \u00a315 million international investment package, working with our partners Ghana, Nigeria, and Kenya to bolster their health workforces.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But this is just the beginning.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "All our nations need to work together in a truly global partnership. We are stronger together than alone.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Only then can we deliver universal health coverage, and build a fairer, brighter, and healthier world.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So today, let\u2019s roll up our sleeves and get on with the job.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Thank you.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
