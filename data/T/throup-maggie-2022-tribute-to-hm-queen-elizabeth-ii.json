        "Although not originally destined to ascend to the throne, in 1952 our new Queen stood out as one of the few married working mothers, and certainly the only female Head of State of any major western power. Seven decades later, and following Her Majesty\u2019s example, women have firmly cemented their position in the workplace. They are represented in every sector, from construction to Government\u2014perhaps the most poignant reminder of which was the appointment, just four days ago, of my right hon.
