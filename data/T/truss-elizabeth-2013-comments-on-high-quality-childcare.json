        "When parents hand their child over to the care of a childminder or nursery they are not just entrusting them with their child\u2019s physical safety; they are also entrusting their child\u2019s brain.

        "Parents want a choice of quality home-based care, quality nursery care or a combination of both.

        "At the moment, many nursery and private, voluntary and independent settings do not use full ratios. We think teacher-led settings with full ratios and structured activities are a good thing.
