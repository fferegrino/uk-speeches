        "I remember, as a young child, social workers coming to our home so regularly that on occasion I naively thought they were family friends.

        "And later, in my work in the family courts, there were many times I sat alongside social workers making difficult and momentous decisions that would change lives and having to justify them both in and out of court. Often cooped up in a stuffy conference room for most of the day, planning, negotiating, resolving conflict, seeking legal advice, seeking out a sandwich, all whilst trying to juggle the other cases outside of court they were responsible for.

Now I\u2019m not in the business of ignorantly criticising the social work profession. Yes, I think it needs improvement. Yes, I think we can do better. And yes, I think the structures you work in are often outdated and don\u2019t support you as they should.

        "But, as we know, too often you only get public recognition for the bad things \u2013 when things go wrong.

        "It\u2019s why we\u2019ve supported Frontline and Step Up, programmes which both, in their way, are changing the image of social work; making it an aspirational profession rather than one which has too often been viewed by the public as a last-choice career. So it\u2019s hugely encouraging that Frontline received 2700 applications for its first 100 posts, all of them from top graduates.

It\u2019s right to say that we\u2019ve made some progress already in reducing red tape and freeing you from unduly restrictive assessment timescales.
