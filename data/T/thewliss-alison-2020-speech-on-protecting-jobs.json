        "People across these islands are going through the most difficult of times. In the past six months, people have lost loved ones; they have not been able to have the human contact we all need; and they have struggled to keep themselves and their families going. Communities have pulled together admirably to help their neighbours, but businesses of all sizes have found it difficult, and an estimated 730,000 jobs have been lost so far. Ending the employment support schemes prematurely could cost 3 million jobs.

Until public health grounds for closure are removed, the SNP believes that the Government have a clear responsibility to assist and support wherever they can.

If he ran a business, could he survive and pay wages, pay for stock, the rent and all the bills on the grants he has announced?

The British Chambers of Commerce\u2019s quarterly recruitment outlook revealed that 29% of firms expect to axe jobs over the third quarter\u2014a record high. At the same time, the number of new job opportunities is also depressed across almost all sectors, as is reflected in the various vacancies data. For example, the Office for National Statistics and Adzuna data show the number of online job vacancies for Scotland for the week to 21 August to be almost half the 2019 average\u2014down 49 percentage points\u2014and the Office for Budget Responsibility has \u200bwarned that UK unemployment could surpass the peaks of the 1980s after weaker than expected economic growth.
