        "I predict today\u2019s Sunday Times story by @Gabriel_Pogrund won\u2019t be the last time Liz Truss gets in trouble asking the taxpayer to foot the bill for her expensive tastes.

        "Back in December 2020, Truss and 3 staff went on a four-night trip to Singapore and Vietnam to sign the cut-and-paste rollover agreements to maintain free trade post-Brexit.
