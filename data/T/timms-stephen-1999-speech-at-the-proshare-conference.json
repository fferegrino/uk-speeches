        "First, employees for the first time will be able to buy shares in their company out of their pre tax salary.

        "Of course, holding shares is risky, unlike the one way bet of an option \u2013 employees will need to understand this when they decide to buy shares and employers will need to communicate this carefully to their employees.

        "There are also features of the new plan to help reduce this risk. Because they buy shares out of the pre-tax salary employees are in effect always buying shares at a discount.

        "The second revolutionary feature reflects the fact that many companies have told us that they want employees to demonstrate their commitment to the company by buying shares.

        "Other companies have told us that they have been put off from having a plan in the past because they would have to give shares to all their employees, regardless of their performance or their commitment to staying with the company. So our third innovation in the new plan is that companies can now award shares on a performance basis, if they want to. They can also take back shares awarded to employees who decide not to stay with them.  \nRewarding performance in this way will help companies to create a more competitive environment within their business. This in turn will lead to greater efficiencies and more innovation. But again, all this must be done on a basis that is fair to employees. It will be up to companies to choose any performance measure that suit their business, as long as these are objective and fair. Companies must be open with their workforce about how performance will be measured. Indeed this is how any modern, successful business should treat its employees if it is going to get the best from them.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
