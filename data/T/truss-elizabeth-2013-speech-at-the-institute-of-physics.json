        "If we are to do better in the PISA rankings, it\u2019s vitally important that we particularly improve the performance of girls in critical subjects like maths and science.

        "For school pupils, that means that studying maths and sciences opens up their career options, whatever field they want to work in.

        "If we think about any industry now, people with maths skills, physics skills and computer science skills are vital, because technology is transforming those industries.

        "We need to get away from the idea that it\u2019s just a few scientists in a laboratory who need these skills. Maths and science are universal skills that all our young people need.

        "We also know there are increasing returns to education across the OECD.

        "The Institute of Physics has pointed out the problem we have. In 2010 to 2012, 4 times as many boys took A level physics as girls did; 60% of the entries to A level maths were boys.
