        "First of all the challenge is to be able to keep taxes low. Often my number one job is saying \u2018no\u2019 to people who want to spend more money because I know that ultimately for every extra pound we spend that\u2019s a pound we have to raise in tax, and we have been able to keep corporation tax at 19% which is the lowest in the G20. We\u2019ve been able to lower business rates, particularly for those businesses on High Streets. I\u2019m sure there are many people in this room who feel that there are issues still with tax. I certainly think there is a lot of room to simplify our tax system. I think it\u2019s become over complicated.

        "The second area to highlight is infrastructure.

        "The second area I\u2019d highlight is improving regulation and red tape. I think the government is always in danger of creating too much red tape. I\u2019m interested in how we can simplify that landscape and how we can make it easier for businesses to engage. How we can flag up where there are bodies which maybe not intentionally, but quite often unintentionally, might be creating those problems. I think the biggest area I\u2019d highlight of regulation is the planning system.
