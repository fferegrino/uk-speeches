        "It\u2019s great to be here at the Institute for Government today. I\u2019m having a rather more relaxing September than I did last year. And you might well ask, Why am I back talking about the same topic? But it\u2019s one year ago that I launched my government and our economic policy. And I\u2019m speaking here today, not because I want to relive the events of last year. I certainly don\u2019t. It\u2019s not because I\u2019m keen to be back in Downing Street. I\u2019m certainly not. It\u2019s because one year after saying that economic growth was the central issue for our country. Since then, we\u2019ve heard a lot of people say that right across the political spectrum. That still is not agreement, or what has caused the problems of a lack of economic growth, but also what on earth we\u2019re going to do about them.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations",
        "And I think these issues are only getting more urgent. The reality is that over time, we\u2019re not bringing in as much money as a country. We have the highest debt interest payments in the developed world. And according to the Growth Commission, the average person in the UK is now \u00a39,100 worse off than the average person in the United States. I believe the reason that we have this problem is 25 years of economic consensus that has led to a period of stagnation and I believe that we need to shatter that economic consensus if we\u2019re to avoid worse problems in the future.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations",
        "The fact is the British public know that the consensus isn\u2019t working, Lord Ashcroft\u2019s poll on the state we\u2019re in released on 4th September. revealed that 72% of people in Britain agree that Britain is broken, people are getting poorer, nothing seems to work. We need big changes to the way the country is run, whichever party is a government.

        "Now there are some people who claim that this is a crisis of capitalism, that we\u2019ve had too much free markets, but quite the opposite is true. The fact is that since Labour was elected in 1997, we have moved towards being a more corporatist social democracy than we were in the 70s, in the 80s and the 90s. State spending now accounts for 46% of GDP, higher than it was in every year in Britain except for 1975 and up from 34.8% in the year 2000.

        "There\u2019s also a growing burden of regulation. The cost of regulations introduced in 2022 alone is 10 billion pounds according to the government, and I believe that is an underestimate in the sectors that are key arteries of the economy, whether it\u2019s energy, housing and banking, there is less competition or more government involvement than there was 25 years ago. The government still owns a 40% stake in NatWest.

        "The cost of welfare and pensions has ballooned by 50% in real terms, since the turn of the millennium, and even on an income of 50,000 pounds, it\u2019s still possible to claim Universal Credit. Our tax system has become more complicated, with many facing high marginal tax rates when they seek to earn more income. Somebody earning 100,000 pounds with a student loan faces a marginal tax rate of 71%. We\u2019ve had cheap money for over a decade, with nearly 900 billion pounds pumped into the system by the Bank of England through quantitative easing in an era of the near zero interest rates, something that\u2019s completely unprecedented in 300 years of UK central banking. So how on earth did we get to this situation? Well, my view is that after the successful monetary policy, and supply side reforms of the 1980s, and the winning of the Cold War by the West, we were all optimistic and upbeat about our future and we took our eye off the ball.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations",

And we\u2019ve seen that regardless of which government has been in power, from the energy price gap to the 2050 climate change target to the ESG agenda in companies. There\u2019s been a cultural shift across both business and the public sector. Towards a lot more left wing policies. And despite the long record of failure of industrial policy, it\u2019s back in vogue again, people are talking about it. And at the heart of this was the basic belief by politicians that the good times would go on forever. The discussion was about sharing the proceeds of growth. It was about general well-being and happiness rather than GDP. The only question seemed to be how we will get to redistribute the pie. Not about growing the pie in the first place. But the problem is that 25 years later, we have seen a growing size and scope of the state.

Public Sector productivity is woeful, and millionaires are voting with their feet. The UK is third after Russia and China for the departure of high net worth individuals. And despite all of the evidence that these incentives have a major impact. There\u2019s been a fatalistic consensus that these levels of growth in Britain are inevitable.

We should aim to get that ratio we achieved at the turn of the millennium.

The supply side revolution now has to take on the burden of regulation and an overlarge over powerful bureaucracy which has the whip hand over the elected government. This supply side revolution has to encompass changes to tax regulation and the size of the state.
