Might Ministers be running away because of the Select Committee\u2019s report stating they lack a \u201ccoherent trade strategy\u201d? Or might the Government be hiding from scrutiny because of the chaos at the Department itself? Members do not have to take my word for it. Yesterday, the Secretary of State was saying of her own Minister of State for Trade Policy, the right hon.
