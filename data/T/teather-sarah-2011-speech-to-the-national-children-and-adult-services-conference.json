        "This is not an easy time to be in government at any level. It\u2019s not an easy time to be in national government, and it\u2019s not an easy time to be in local government.

        "It is much shorter and much less prescriptive. It will be up to local authorities to determine their structures. It is important that we\u2019re able to assure ourselves that we have in place the clear line of accountability that Lord Laming and Professor Munro saw as critical to the well-being and safety of children and young people.
