        "I also recently visited Germany and saw first-hand how high-quality, well-planned extra-curricular activities, supervised by highly-qualified, non-teaching staff, have been integrated into schools in Berlin and are catering for children of all ages. These staff work closely with teachers to support pupils throughout the school day \u2013 which, with lessons interspersed with non-academic activities and study time, can run from half seven in the morning to four o\u2019clock in the evening. Wrap-around care in some schools extends that offer from six in the morning until six at night.
