        "The Government are delaying the implementation of the volume price promotion restrictions and the introduction of further advertising restrictions on TV and online for high fat, sugar or salt (HFSS) products by 12 months.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
        "We are clear that the delay to volume price promotions does not impact the locations measures which will still come into force on 1 October 2022. Under these measures, less healthy products in scope will no longer be promoted in key locations, such as checkouts, store entrances, aisle ends and their online equivalents. We expect these location restrictions to be the single most impactful obesity policy at reducing children\u2019s calorie consumption and are expected to accrue health benefits of over \u00a357 billion and provide NHS savings of over \u00a34 billion, over the next 25 years.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
        "The delay to restrictions on multibuy deals will allow the Government to review and monitor the impact of the restrictions on the cost of living in light of an unprecedented global economic situation.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
        "A delay to the advertising restrictions is necessary because a delay in the Health and Care Act 2022 receiving Royal Assent has had a consequential impact on the timetable for the regulators\u2019 subsequent consultations and publication of final guidance, meaning it was unlikely this would be ready with sufficient time before implementation.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
        "We have also considered the ongoing concerns from industry about having time to fully implement the final guidance, by restructuring their funding and revenue streams appropriately, and ensuring robust compliance from implementation. We therefore believe this is the best approach to balance tackling childhood obesity in a timely way, managing the unprecedented economic situation and ensuring the smooth and effective implementation of these restrictions.

        "We included a power in the Health and Care Act to delay implementation of the advertising restrictions if necessary. We will be utilising this power to amend the date of implementation for the advertising restrictions by secondary legislation. The implementation of the volume price restrictions will also be amended by secondary legislation.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
        "This Government remain committed to halving childhood obesity by 2030 and these measures and others, including last month\u2019s new measures on calorie labelling in large restaurants, cafes and takeaways, will play their part in delivering against this ambition.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework"
