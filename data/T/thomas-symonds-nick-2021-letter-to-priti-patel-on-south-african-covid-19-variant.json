        "This is a deeply concerning development: we know how dangerous emerging strains of the virus are and it is worrying that vaccines could be less effective against the South African strain and other variants of concern.

        "That is why Labour has consistently called for a comprehensive hotel quarantine system, to do everything possible to stop variants reaching the UK. However, the UK Government has refused to act on these warnings and the prospects of further outbreaks remain incredibly concerning.

        "Can it be identified via contact tracing that the outbreak was caused by an individual/individuals travelling back into this country?  \nWhat conversations has your Department had with the Global Travel Taskforce?  \nHow many individuals are currently going into hotel quarantine?  \nHow many travellers are currently entering the country each day?  \nWe are entering a critical juncture in our fight against the pandemic.
