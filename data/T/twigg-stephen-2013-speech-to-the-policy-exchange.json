It\u2019s the kind of consensus that is totally lacking in Michael Gove\u2019s plans to introduce EBacc Certificates. Or I should say there is a consensus, just not in favour. It spans the CBI, the designer of the iPhone, the head of the Tate gallery, the leading private schools, the head of Ofqual and many teachers and their associations. It\u2019s not often they can all agree.

And only seven per cent of young people went on to post-16 education, I was part of a privileged elite.
