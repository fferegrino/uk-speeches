        "Let me just say at the outset that I\u2019m excited about First Tuesday. I was in Silicon Valley last September and visited the MIT/Stanford Venture Lab which is also a public forum where entrepreneurs, managers and investors come to swap ideas and learn from each other. I impressed upon them on that occasion the opportunities for investment in the UK today, but the creative energy in that forum was unmistakable and I asked my officials what was happening here in the UK. They told me: First Tuesday. So I am delighted finally to be here.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
        "Just yesterday I visited Cambridge University Entrepreneurs, run by students, which has just announced the winners of its business plan competition. They had four times as many entries as they allowed for. The winners have already had individual mentoring from top industry figures, and now they are going to receive start up funding. There is a real sea change with a new enthusiasm for entrepreneurship, and tonight, I want to talk about our hopes for the knowledge economy.

        "The first economic priority after the election was to achieve stability in the UK economy after decades of boom and bust. That has been achieved in a remarkable way, so our focus now is on locking in that hard won stability, and building on it for the future.
