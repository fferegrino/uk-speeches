        "A real terms cut in funding for affordable housing shows where the Tories\u2019 priorities really lie: slashing planning regulations for their wealthy developer backers, not building good quality, environmentally sustainable and truly affordable housing for workers.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "It\u2019s no wonder that Government wants to scrap planning regulations: the evidence from the Robert Jenrick cash-for-favours scandal shows us how desperate they are to help billionaire donors abuse the planning system and ride rough-shod over local people.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Yet again the Conservatives are saying one thing and doing another while trying to deflect from their abysmal record on housebuilding after being in power for ten years.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
