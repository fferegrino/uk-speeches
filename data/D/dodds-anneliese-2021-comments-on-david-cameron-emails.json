        "These emails confirm Treasury officials knew Greensill was in financial trouble as early as the 21 March last year. They also knew Greensill applied to the CLBILS Covid loan scheme on 24 April.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "We need to follow the money. Greensill was carrying the begging bowl from the Bank of England to the Treasury and back. It was desperate for access to taxpayer money, and the Government granted that access by accrediting it to the CLBILS scheme in June.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayer cash were put at risk by that decision. We need to understand why the Chancellor and the Treasury did nothing when they were aware Greensill was deep in the red three months earlier.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The Chancellor can\u2019t keep ducking this. He must come out of hiding and explain his role in the return of Conservative sleaze.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
