        "1\\. Ladies and gentlemen, it is a tremendous privilege for me to be invited to address the CBI\u2019s annual dinner.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "2\\. The success of British businesses is the foundation on which this country\u2019s economic prosperity is built. Your energy, your creativity and your commitment to wealth creation are the engine that drives the British economy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "3\\. I also want to thank the CBI for the crucial role it plays in promoting the interests of British businesses at home and abroad.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "4\\. Over the past ten years \u2013 at Trade and Industry, Transport and now at the Treasury \u2013 I have been a great advocate of British businesses. The continued success of the British economy will rest on how government and business can work together, which is why the importance of the relationship between the Treasury and the CBI cannot be overstated.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "5\\. I want you to know that I am listening to you, and even though there will be times when we do not agree, it does not mean that I have not heard what you have to say.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "6\\. And you can be sure that on one issue, we will always find common ground \u2013 that the competitiveness of the British economy and British businesses should be at the heart of our economic agenda. We will do nothing to jeopardise that.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "7\\. Our work with the CBI and TUC to get agreement on the Agency Workers\u2019 Directive is a good example of how we can work together \u2013 protecting vulnerable workers \u2013 while at the same time ensuring support for business. John Hutton and I want to acknowledge the huge effort put in by the CBI in resolving this difficult issue.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "8\\. On the Working Time Directive, we shall continue to argue for the opt out, so that we can balance fairness at work with the ability to remain competitive at all times.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "9\\. For the last decade the foundation of our success as a country, and your success as businesses, has been a strong and stable economy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "10\\. While other countries have suffered recessions, the British economy has been growing continuously for over a decade \u2013 the longest period of sustained growth in our history.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "11\\. And especially at this time, it is essential that we do everything in our power to maintain stability and to support business and the wider economy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "12\\. But it is equally important that we should not be diverted from our long-term aim \u2013 to equip our country for the competitive challenge of the next decade and beyond.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "13\\. The world is experiencing the biggest economic upheaval it has seen in recent times. And every country is affected.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "14\\. Continued uncertainty in the global financial markets, tighter credit conditions and rising world commodity prices \u2013 with the price of oil doubling over the past year \u2013 all this affects you and the way in which you do business.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "15\\. Families are facing rising food and energy bills, companies too are facing increased costs.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "16\\. Inflation, while at low levels compared to the peaks we have seen in the past, remains a threat to economic stability.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "17\\. But while the global outlook remains uncertain, I remain optimistic about the underlying strength and resilience of the British economy \u2013 and confident that we will get through this difficult time.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "18\\. Every major economy expects to see slower growth this year.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "19\\. But despite this slowdown, the world economy will continue to grow by around four per cent this year. In China, by over eight per cent, India by over 7 per cent. The Euro-area, and sixty per cent of our exports go to Europe, by one and three quarters per cent.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "20\\. And the British economy will also continue to grow, underpinned, as it is, by record levels of employment.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "21\\. Let us not talk about what might go wrong and while the financial sector has experienced a particularly difficult time, industrial and commercial Britain as a whole is in sound financial shape.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "22\\. As many of you know, many British businesses are doing well, with healthy order books here and abroad.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "23\\. But we cannot be complacent. Here in the UK \u2013 and in every country across the world \u2013 there is a determination to do everything possible to support growth and maintain stability.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "24\\. At the macroeconomic level, the Government fully supports the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England in the difficult decisions it faces. As it balances the upside risk to inflation in the short term from global price shocks, against the longer term downside risk to growth and inflation, as a result of the global credit squeeze.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "25\\. Debt is lower than in the past and low by international standards. Our fiscal policy is designed to support monetary policy to maintain stability in these uncertain economic times.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "26\\. But we need to do more. That is why I agreed to the Bank of England\u2019s special liquidity scheme launched last month.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "27\\. It has helped stabilise the financial markets and it will contribute to greater confidence which will over time support lending in the economy \u2013 to businesses and especially in the housing market.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "28\\. And I have asked Sir James Crosby to report to me shortly on what more can be done to support the wholesale and securitisation markets and increase the amount of money available for mortgage finance.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "29\\. And tomorrow the Chief Secretary and the Housing Minister will meet with industry and consumer and debt advice groups to consider what they can do to support borrowers in difficulty.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "30\\. Small and medium sized firms are facing pressures from the credit squeeze. That is why I took the decision to extend the Small Loans Guarantee Fund.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "31\\. And why we are also asking the European Investment Bank to do more to provide funds for these firms here in Britain \u2013 to increase the support it provides by expanding the range of finance on offer to small and medium enterprise from traditional loans to, for example, equity finance.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "32\\. In addition, I want to ensure that this finance is available to a broader range of businesses, so I will also be asking the EIB to take a larger share of the lending they back by banks to small business.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "33\\. Many of you here have already seized the opportunities that come from operating in a truly global market.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "34\\. London has grown to become the world\u2019s leading financial centre. That success has been built on, our commitment to free trade, our openness to overseas investment and the flexibility of our product and labour markets.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "35\\. But globalisation brings challenges too. A problem in America\u2019s housing market last summer affected the whole world in just a few weeks.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "36\\. We need to learn the lessons from that and will reform the banking laws to ensure we can deal more effectively with the risk of bank failure. But we will avoid a heavy-handed response which would be counter-productive and endanger London as the best financial centre to do business.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "37\\. So we will maintain our risk-based and proportionate approach to regulation.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "38\\. These are international problems which demand international action.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "39\\. That is why are working through the IMF and the Financial Stability Forum to get better early warning of mounting problems and to strengthen co-operation between supervisors and regulators.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "40\\. But here again, we will defend our approach to regulation in Europe and internationally, for example, by resisting the calls for direct regulation of executive pay. It is the role of Boards and their shareholders, not governments or regulators, to set the level of executive remuneration.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "41\\. And we should adopt the same approach \u2013 one based on openness, free trade and flexible markets \u2013 in addressing the two big problems facing developed and developing countries alike \u2013 rising oil and food prices.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "42\\. Now is not the time for putting up barriers to trade or increasing tariffs. Quite the opposite. Now is the time for all of us \u2013 governments and business \u2013 to make the case for more open and fair trade. It is time to reject calls for increased protectionism, wherever they come from.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "43\\. A fair world trade deal is increasingly urgent. Not just for food, but for other goods and services. We need a successful conclusion to the Doha trade round.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "44\\. The new World Trade Organisation papers move us significantly forward. There is now a deal to be done. But we are in danger of running out of time. Negotiators should return to Geneva and work full time until a deal is done.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "45\\. And at this time perhaps more than any other, it is right to look again at the Common Agricultural Policy. It is unacceptable that at a time of significant food price inflation, the European Union continues to apply very high tariffs to many agricultural imports.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "46\\. The European Union has a clear responsibility to play a full role in the international community\u2019s efforts to address the consequences of spiralling food prices, but it also has a responsibility to its own citizens to ensure that its policies do not unnecessarily inflate the cost of food.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "47\\. And it is time too for international action in the face of remorselessly rising oil prices. I shall be raising this issue at the G8 in Japan next month, and shall be proposing that we discuss with oil producers how we reduce these costs.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "48\\. And while we need to act to try to ease constraints to supply, high oil and energy prices reinforce the need for us all to become more energy efficient, to keep down costs and support security of supply.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "49\\. So there are significant challenges in the world economy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "50\\. Challenges that require government and business to work together to resist protectionism, bring down barriers to trade and continue to push the case for open markets.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "51\\. But let us also remember the strengths and successes in the British economy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "52\\. Knowledge based businesses now account for over half our job growth in the last 20 years.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "53\\. The biotechnology sector leads Europe in terms of capitalisation revenues and product development.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "54\\. The pharmaceutical industry accounts for nearly a quarter of business R&D expenditure.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "55\\. Companies invest over \u00a33 billion in medical research. We have supported them with R&D tax credits, as well as measures designed to tackle animal rights extremism.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "56\\. Public investment in science will rise to over \u00a36 billion. Invention and innovation is transferring from universities to the market place across every sector of the economy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "57\\. In aerospace we are shaping the design and manufacture of the next generation, supporting over 270,000 jobs across the economy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "58\\. And British design and manufacturing is winning orders here and across the world.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "59\\. Here is living proof of business success underpinned in many cases by public investment and support.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "60\\. And the Treasury\u2019s core purpose must be to maintain a strong macroeconomic framework and to promote growth.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "61\\. But the Treasury must also be at the heart of making changes both in society and in the economy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "62\\. Working with you, we have a central role in increasing our longer-term competitiveness. And if we are to ensure economic growth we need to have a clear understanding of where the economy is strong and where its strengths will lie in the future. And to use that understanding to drive competitiveness in areas of that strength.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "63\\. Thirty years ago there was much debate about whether governments could pick winners. There still is such debate in some countries today.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "64\\. Now I do not believe that governments can pick out individual companies or industries, nor should they. But what we do can make a difference; supporting industries which are thriving and encouraging those that are developing and have the potential to succeed. We need a new approach.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "65\\. We are not talking of subsidies or protectionism. Rather we want, sector by sector, to look at how government action impacts on, and can promote, business success. In some areas, it might be a case of getting out of the way. But I believe that it is important that we are ready to reinforce what we are good at.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "66\\. And I am working across Government to ensure the impacts of what we do on specific industries are taken into account.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "67\\. There are opportunities too for business as we meet the challenges ahead.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "68\\. Climate change, and the need to reduce our dependence on carbon fuels provides new opportunities.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "69\\. We need more renewables and have given the go ahead for replacing nuclear power stations. That is work here in Britain. Let us seize the opportunity, so that British industry can benefit. Not just from construction, but from research and development too.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "70\\. Supporting science. Spending more on universities and skills. It comes at a cost, but it is essential.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "71\\. So too is investment in transport. Crossrail was vital for London and the UK and we need to spend more on rail.
