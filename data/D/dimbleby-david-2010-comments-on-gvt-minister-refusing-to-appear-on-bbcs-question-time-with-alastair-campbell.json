        "This being the week of the Queen\u2019s speech with the Government announcing its proposed legislation we would have expected to have a Government minister on the panel. Downing Street said that a Cabinet Minister was available for tonight and would join us but only on condition that our Labour panellist was not Alastair Campbell, but a Labour frontbencher and of course it is for us at Question Time to decide who should be on our panels, not for Downing Street. So we refused to replace Alastair Campbell which means we have no member  \nof the Government here tonight but I\u2019m glad to say we have John Redwood here to represent the Conservative Party.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
