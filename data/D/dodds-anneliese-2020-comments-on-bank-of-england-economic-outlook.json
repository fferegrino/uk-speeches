        "Today\u2019s assessment by the Bank of England shows that this is a critical moment for our economy. A short-term, post-lockdown rise in spending sits alongside a much more uncertain long-term picture of very low levels of business investment and the prospect of a sharp rise in unemployment.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The Government has still not got a grip on the health crisis and we won\u2019t recover from this economic crisis until it does. That means fixing test, trace and isolate to give people the confidence they need to go back out and get spending again.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "And the Chancellor is still ploughing on with his one-size-fits-all approach to withdrawing income support, despite calls from businesses to think again. If he won\u2019t, the recovery will be stopped in its tracks and the jobs crisis Britain faces will get much worse. It\u2019s not too late to change course.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
