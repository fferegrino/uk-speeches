        "The world has been transformed over the last few years. We live in a global economy. We are moving towards a single global economy in many respects. Industries typically span geographical and political boundaries. No country can go it alone, in economic terms. Our objective is to ensure Britain is equipped to rise to the challenge of the world\u2019s new and fast changing economies.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The key objective of our economic policy is to achieve high and stable levels of growth and employment, to allow everyone to share in higher living standards.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "Over the past forty years, our economy has had an unenviable history of boom and bust. Stop-go has meant higher interest rates, less investment, fewer successful companies and lost jobs. It has been the inevitable result of a failure to take a long-term view, and to bow to short term pressures \u2013 political and economic.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The economy we inherited in May was in danger of over-heating, with unsustainable growth in demand and a threat of inflation rising well above its target. And despite five years of upswing, public borrowing was too high for the point in the economic cycle. The national debt doubled in the six years from 1990. And at this stage of the cycle the we should not be adding to that problem. This year alone the taxpayer will pay out 25 billion Pounds in interest payments on debt \u2013 more than we spend on our schools.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "So we need to address the fundamental weaknesses in the economy. Instability, under-investment, the need to improve education and skills and the need for welfare reform \u2013 all of which have been neglected for too long.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "In the eight months since we took office we have begun to put in place the building blocks we need:\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "Stability will of course depend, to a large extent, on markets having confidence in the commitment of Government to prudent and sound management of the economy. So economic policy must be open and transparent. Openness builds confidence and credibility. It is essential in today\u2019s global economy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "And in our fiscal and monetary policies, we have set out open and transparent frameworks that have clearly enhanced our credibility.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The Government will now publish a Pre-Budget consultation document each year setting out the economic issues we face. Operational independence for the Bank of England. The new code for fiscal stability. All these measures add to openness and transparency, and will enhance credibility in our determination to look to the long term.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "That is why one of our first acts in office was to establish a wholly new monetary policy framework for the UK.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "This framework gives operational independence to the Bank of England for setting interest rates to meet the Government\u2019s inflation target, while enhancing accountability and ensuring policy is conducted in an open way. We now have one of the most open procedures for making monetary policies decisions in the world. Since the new monetary framework was announced, long-term interest rates have fallen by more than a full percentage point, partly reflecting a fall in inflation expectations. Clear evidence that anti-inflation credibility has been enhanced.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "##  Fiscal policy \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "As with our approach to monetary policy, so in fiscal policy we have established clear rules, a new discipline, openness and accountability.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "A key element of the new fiscal framework is the adoption of two strict fiscal rules:\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "* first, the golden rule, that on average over the economic cycle, the government will borrow only to finance its investment; \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "* and second that, as a proportion of national income, public debt will be held at a prudent and stable level on average over the cycle. \n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Our tough approach to public borrowing, embodied in a five-year deficit reduction plan, means, from public sector borrowing of 7 per cent of GDP four years ago, we are now set to cut the deficit to 1 1/4 per cent in the current financial year and just 1/2 per cent next year.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "And the new Code for Fiscal Stability will require the Government to produce estimates of the cyclically-adjusted fiscal position and long-term projections, so that past policy mistakes are not repeated. We are determined not to repeat the mistakes of the late 1980s, where the signals were misread. Over-optimistic assumptions led to an unsustainable boom, followed by one of the deepest recessions this country has ever seen.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "We will maintain strict discipline in public spending, rooting out waste and inefficiency as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review. This review will not only achieve discipline in the public finance but it will also set our spending priorities for the rest of this Parliament and beyond.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Together these tough fiscal rules, the deficit reduction plan and a root and branch review of public sector efficiency will ensure a break from the short-termism and expediency of the past. And our fiscal policy will be more credible for being open and accountable and will ensure new long-term stability for the public finances.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "The second key challenge is to raise productivity.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Government and industry must work together to remove systematically all barriers to raising productivity: in product markets through encouraging competition and innovation; in capital markets through measures to enhance growth and investment, not least for innovative small businesses; and in the workplace through encouraging the creativity and flexibility of inventors, managers and workforces. We need to rediscover our capacity to invent and see that there is profitable production.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "We are examining how, to improve productivity, we can help leading-edge businesses gain funds to develop new technologies; how we can improve Britain\u2019s poor record of investment in research and development; and how we can make it easier for small businesses to draw on venture capital to create jobs and a more entrepreneurial culture.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "We have taken measures to tackle long-term under-investment in both capacity and skills, including a cut in corporation tax to its lowest ever level. We are determined to increase investment in education \u2013 the key to our future.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "But we still need further structural reforms if we are to encourage a more dynamic economy through increased competition and through reforms in welfare and employment policy. We are committed to a wholesale modernisation of the welfare state.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "And to achieve high and stable levels of growth and employment we must ensure that people are skilled and employable and making work pay.

        "Reform to both the tax and benefit system is needed as part of the modernisation of the welfare state, that has remained largely unreformed since its foundation in the 1940s.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "Since May we have made a start by announcing a New Deal worth almost 4 billion Pounds, providing jobs for young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, and to lone parents [and the long-term sick and disabled].\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "We are also introducing a plan to extend out-of-school childcare clubs to every community in Britain. Funds will be available to set-up as many as 30,000 new out-of-school clubs, which will provide places for nearly 1 million children.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
