        "Being Home Secretary is one of the toughest jobs around, and it takes a tough character to take it on. Priti Patel is working non-stop to deliver what our country voted for \u2013 things like more police on our streets and creating a points-based immigration system.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Since I entered Parliament, Priti Patel has been one of the kindest, most supportive people I\u2019ve met. I\u2019ve lost count of how often she\u2019s found time in her hectic diary to discuss local issues and even just to check in and see how I\u2019m doing, or offer advice on being a new MP.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
