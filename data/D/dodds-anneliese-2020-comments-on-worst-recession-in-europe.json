        "We\u2019ve already got the worst excess death rate in Europe \u2013 now we\u2019re on course for the worst recession too. That\u2019s a tragedy for the British people and it\u2019s happened on Boris Johnson\u2019s watch.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The Prime Minister will say there\u2019s only so much he could do during a global pandemic, but that doesn\u2019t explain why our economy is tanking so badly compared to other countries.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "It was his government that snatched away wage support for businesses that hadn\u2019t even reopened yet. And his government that failed to get test, trace and isolate working despite claiming it\u2019s a \u2018world-beating\u2019 system.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "A downturn was inevitable after lockdown \u2013 but Johnson\u2019s jobs crisis wasn\u2019t. Now he must take responsibility, scrap the one-size-fits-all withdrawal of wage support and bring the health crisis properly under control.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
