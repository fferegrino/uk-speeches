        "Labour has argued for over a decade that cuts to corporation tax don\u2019t boost investment or raise extra revenue \u2013 they just cost the Treasury billions that could have been put to better use.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "We welcome the Chancellor\u2019s conversion to our point of view, but we can never get back the \u00a395 billion lost to the Treasury over the last few years from this economically illiterate tax cut.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "That money could have been used to strengthen our economy going into this crisis. Instead the Conservatives slashed salaries for key workers, ran down our schools and hospitals, and cut 21,000 police officers from our streets.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Never again should any Conservative government be allowed to use such a discredited economic argument to weaken the foundations of our country.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
