        "Over the last few weeks, it has become clear that when one of their mates is found guilty of breaking the rules, this Government\u2019s first instinct is to rip them up, rather than accept the punishment.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The Standards Committee proposals to strengthen the MP\u2019s Code of Conduct published today, are a welcome step in recognising that the processes around lobbying need addressing and that conflicts of interest need nipping in the bud.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Labour supports a ban on directorships and paid consultancy and will examine the detail of the Committee\u2019s final report when it comes in the new year to ensure any moves to do so are comprehensive and watertight. When the report is published, the House of Commons must be given the chance to fully debate and approve measures to toughen up the system.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
