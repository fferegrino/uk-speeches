Not for the first time, it has been too slow to take action and we\u2019re now facing a potential disaster if the ban is lifted with no plan for what comes next.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
