        "The situation couldn\u2019t be more urgent. The Government has three days to avoid a cliff edge, with thousands of people at risk of eviction and homelessness. The Government can still change course. They must extend the ban, and come out with a credible plan to protect renters during this crisis.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
