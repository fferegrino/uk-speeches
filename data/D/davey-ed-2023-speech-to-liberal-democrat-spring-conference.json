        "I never knew my dad was a Liberal. He passed away when I was four \u2013 so we never got to talk politics.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "To be honest, I\u2019d always assumed he was a Tory because mum told me he used to play snooker at the local Conservative club.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "So you can imagine what it meant to me when, years later, I came across this newspaper cutting my gran had kept \u2013 I guess from the late 1950s \u2013 about a garden party held by the Mansfield Divisional Liberal Association.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "With a fancy dress parade and music from something called the \u201cCodas beat group\u201d. The cutting quotes my dad, \u201cMr John Davey\u201d \u2013 as Chair of the Mansfield Liberals \u2013 saying that, unlike the Government of the day, \u201cLiberals were not \u2018pig-headed and pie-eyed theorists\u2019, but people dedicated to public service. \u201cTheir dedication to service was untouched by selfish motives, and that was the mark of the Liberal.\u201d Well, Dad, I couldn\u2019t have put it better myself!\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Conference, we\u2019re all here today for the same reason that my Dad and his fellow Liberals were in that garden in Mansfield all those years ago: Because of our deep sense of public service. Because we love our country, we love our communities, and we want to serve them. And not a pig-headed pie-eyed theorist in sight!\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "So, it seems I might have, unknowingly, inherited my liberalism from my dad. But I do know I learnt a lot from my mum.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Having lost our dad to cancer, mum raised me and my two brothers on her own \u2013 even as she then became ill with cancer herself. When I was growing up, I didn\u2019t realise how tough it must have been for mum. You don\u2019t, do you? That\u2019s the mark of a great parent.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "I always knew she was a brilliant mum. But looking back I can now see just what a remarkable woman she was. Mum taught me all about compassion. Resilience. Sacrifice.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Loving, caring, and just keeping going. All the things that make us human. But she didn\u2019t do it alone. Remarkable though she was, she couldn\u2019t have done it alone.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Mum needed support from the government. And support from our community. I remember walking our dog with her, to the local post office, to collect her widow\u2019s pension, every fortnight.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "We weren\u2019t especially hard up, but I\u2019ve never forgotten how important those widow pension payments were for her. For us. As she adjusted to life as a single mum. Bringing up three young boys \u2013 all of us under ten, when dad died. And I\u2019ll always remember some fabulous Indian curries that our neighbours \u2013 the Malhotras \u2013 used to bring round when mum was ill. And after she was gone. Just to make things that little bit easier for us.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Conference, the incredible power of strong communities and a strong social safety net, must never be taken for granted. And the values I learnt from my mum \u2013 and my experiences looking after her during her long, painful illness \u2013 they\u2019ve shaped my life and driven my politics. Probably far more than any liberal DNA I got from my dad.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Compassion. Community. Fairness. Those are the values that make me a liberal. They\u2019re why I\u2019m a Liberal Democrat.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Why I\u2019ve always fought for social justice. For strong communities and for a more caring society. And they\u2019re the values that make me so proud of our party. And when I meet people acting out those values every day across our United Kingdom, it also makes me so proud to be British.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "But Conference, those liberal, British values are also why I am so angry with this Conservative Government. Because they just don\u2019t get it. I\u2019m angry at the way these Conservatives have squandered the hard work and sacrifices of the British people.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "As families and pensioners, businesses and workers have all spent the last year battling soaring energy bills, rising food prices and the long shadow of the pandemic \u2013\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The Conservatives have indulged in damaging party infighting and dangerous ideological experiments. Pig-headed and pie-eyed, my dad would have said! And I\u2019m not just talking about Boris Johnson or Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "I\u2019m talking about every single Conservative MP: at every step of the way putting their own narrow self-interest above our national interest.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The Conservatives: always so out-of-touch. Always taking people for granted. What a disgrace they are. Just at a time of crisis, when we did need \u201cstrong and stable\u201d government, the Conservatives gave us chaos and division. When Britain needed integrity, they gave us Boris Johnson.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "When our country needed wise leadership, they gave us Liz Truss. When people needed change, they gave us more of the same with Rishi Sunak. When we needed a gallant crew on the bridge to steer our great British ship through choppy waters,\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "We\u2019ve instead had a bunch of mutinous pirates, only interested in who got to wear the captain\u2019s hat. We needed Hornblower. They gave us Pugwash.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Friends, this is going to sound revolutionary, but bear with me\u2026 When the country faces a cost-of-living crisis, I believe the role of government should be to help people and help businesses, properly. Not make it worse!\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "But apparently these Conservative don\u2019t see it that way.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Their cost-of-living crisis has plunged a million more people into poverty \u2013 many of them children. Tens of thousands of families have been made homeless. Many more families are relying on foodbanks \u2013 including some of the hardest working people in our country. As last week\u2019s Budget confirmed, people are seeing their living standards plummet at a faster rate than ever before. And the Conservatives\u2019 answer? Appoint a new Deputy Chairman to tell people to stop whining. To tell them they can get by on 30p a meal.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "It\u2019s not just that the Conservatives are out-of-touch \u2013 they are on another planet. Just look at the policy choices these Conservatives have made over the last year\u2026 while millions have struggled.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Tax properly the record profits of the oil and gas giants, as Liberal Democrats were the first to argue \u2013 profits made on the back of Putin\u2019s illegal invasion of Ukraine? It\u2019s a \u201cno\u201d from Rishi Sunak. But take money out of the pockets of struggling families with unfair income tax rises? An enthusiastic \u201cyes\u201d from the Conservatives.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Start to cut energy bills as gas prices fall, as we proposed, so families and pensioners don\u2019t have to choose between heating and eating? No way, says Jeremy Hunt.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "But recklessly add hundreds of pounds to people\u2019s monthly mortgage bills, pushing many to the brink of losing their homes? With pleasure, as they all gleefully cheered Liz Truss\u2019s budget.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The Conservatives aren\u2019t serving the public \u2013 they are only serving themselves. Utterly devoid of the values that make our country so great. Compassion. Community.

        "These are touchstones for the British people. They are fundamental to us as Liberal Democrats. But they are alien to today\u2019s Conservative Party.

        "But there is one rule that I think is set in stone \u2013 And that\u2019s how you know when a Government has reached the end of the road. Here it is. You can call it \u201cDavey\u2019s First Law of Politics\u201d if you like.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "Conference, she could have been speaking to us today! But I don\u2019t think even Mrs Maizel could have predicted the sheer depths of the crisis into which the Conservatives have plunged our NHS today.

        "In far too many cases, these delays are the difference between life and death. Between the mother being there to see her daughter get married, or not. Being able to hold her first grandson \u2013 or never getting to meet him. Between enjoying the retirement she\u2019s worked and saved her whole life to earn \u2013 Or never even getting to start it. I know what it means to lose your parents to cancer, far too young. How devastating. How unfair. Of course I get that it\u2019s not always possible to prevent it. But I also know that, for too many families right now, it could have been prevented.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Prevented, if we had a Government truly committed to public service values. And when you look to the future \u2013 Perhaps even worse than plunging our country into the twin crises with cost-of-living and healthcare \u2013 Is the Conservatives\u2019 total lack of ambition to solve people\u2019s problems. And their total lack of vision for the future. At every step of the way \u2013 on the economy, the cost-of-living or the NHS \u2013 Rishi Sunak has had to be dragged kicking and screaming just to do the bare minimum.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "Take economic growth. Remember when governments used to talk about targeting three, four, five percent? Rishi Sunak\u2019s target? Anything above zero. It\u2019s like a mid-table football club with a new manager, targeting to avoid relegation, rather than a place in the Champions League. And Jeremy Hunt in his Budget on Wednesday, proudly boasting not that the economy is growing, but that it might just avoid a technical recession after all. Total defeatism from a government that\u2019s run out of ideas and has nothing left to offer.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The way Conservative MPs talk nowadays, it\u2019s like they know the truth: Their Government needs to be put out of its misery. So what of Labour? Labour\u2019s ambitions are hardly much higher. Their only goal seems to be: \u201cNot as bad as the Conservatives\u201d. Talk about a low bar!\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

We understand that \u2013 whether it\u2019s energy bills, or social care, or the climate crisis, or even the political system itself \u2013 Tinkering around the edges simply isn\u2019t good enough. For us, it\u2019s about more than just changing the faces at the top of politics.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

They want an end to the Conservatives letting water companies get away with pumping filthy sewage straight into our rivers. The biggest environmental crime in our country today. And a crime that will cost the Conservatives dozens of seats if they don\u2019t act. Our historic task is to create a new politics, where government has to respond to all of the people. Not just a few swing-voters in a handful of marginal seats. Or a tiny cabal of big-money donors. With a better electoral system. With more power in the hands of individuals and communities, Politicians and parties will have to be more focused on the things that really matter to people.

You see, unlike Labour, we don\u2019t think the state always knows best what people need. And unlike the Conservatives, we understand that an active state is essential to empower people and enlarge individual freedom.
