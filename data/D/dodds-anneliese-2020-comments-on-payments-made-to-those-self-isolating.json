        "Effective local lockdowns depend on people self-isolating when they\u2019re supposed to. Labour has been warning for months that the Government needs to make sure that people can afford to do the right thing, but once again Ministers have taken far too long to realise there\u2019s a problem.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Just last week the Chancellor suggested there was no need to change the system for people who have to self-isolate. Now the Health Secretary \u2013 who confessed that Statutory Sick Pay in the UK isn\u2019t enough to live on \u2013 thinks the solution is to offer people who aren\u2019t currently eligible the same limited level of support.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "It\u2019s concerning that this will only apply to a limited number of areas with high rates of Covid-19. The instruction to self-isolate applies to everyone in the country, so everyone should get the support they need to self-isolate.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
