    "content": [
        "**Introduction**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "1\\. This is the fourth Proshare award ceremony that I have attended.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "2\\. I am under no illusions about my fate. The day that I entered the Treasury my attention was drawn to the rogues gallery \u2013 the portraits of my predecessors dating back to the early 1960s, when the ancient office of Chief Secretary was established.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "3\\. An examination of the photographs revealed that my five immediate predecessors had all lost their seats at the election two days earlier.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "4\\. In its short five years existence, Proshare has been enormously successful. I have always thought that the 1980s rhetoric of the \u201cshareholding democracy\u201d was misplaced. It was a political slogan. It wasn\u2019t real. Indeed it was counter productive rhetoric.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "5\\. The fact is that more and more people do shares directly or indirectly. That\u2019s all to the good. People should know the relationship between the Stock Market and their shares. And individual shareholding has worked for many but it isn\u2019t for everyone. Lets be realistic about it.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "6\\. But the more people understand share holding the better. We want to encourage people to save and to invest. And Proshare has played a vital part in promoting that wider understanding.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "7\\. And of course, the best and most successful businesses are those where everyone in the enterprise from boardroom to the shop floor is fully engaged in its success. Everyone should have a stake in the enterprise in which they are engaged. It brings out the best in people.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "8\\. And encouraging employee share ownership is a important part of that \u2013 nearly 2 million employees now belong to one of the approved schemes. We want to see employee share ownership expand. Shareholding should encourage participation and responsibility.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "9\\. And Proshare has been active promoting wider understanding of share holding and financial services generally. This award ceremony helps that process.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "10\\. Indeed Proshare is something of a pioneer in promoting the use of plain English \u2013 helping demistify the world of finance.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "**Share holding and saving**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "11\\. We want to encourage saving which is why yesterday we launched the new Individual Savings Account.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "12\\. We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to provide for themselves \u2013 whether they are saving for their future, for their retirement or simply for a rainy day.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "13\\. ISAs are aimed at encouraging everyone to save. They will be simple, flexible and accessible \u2013 something everyone wants and will get.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "14\\. Our objective is to develop a tax system for savings which benefits the many and not just the few. Half the population don\u2019t save. So everyone should have the opportunity to save in a tax-favoured environment, however small the amounts they are able to put aside.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "15\\. As we promised in our manifesto, the ISA builds on the experience of PEPs and TESSAs. That is why investments in ISAs will be tax-free \u2013 up to 50,000 \u2013 and 100,000 Pounds for couples.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "16\\. We spend 1.3 billion Pounds on tax relief under the present system \u2013 rising to 1.7 billion Pounds in 2001-02. Much of this goes to those who can already afford to save significant amounts and to tie their savings up for long periods of time. That isn\u2019t an efficient use of public money. Our objective is to bring in new savers.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "17\\. Far better and fairer to use the existing provision to bring the benefits of ISAs to a much wider population of savers \u2013 possibly encouraging 6 million new savers. That is right in principle and it is fair.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "18\\. Two weeks ago we published our consultation paper on stakeholder pensions. The consultation document we published yesterday on ISAs builds upon this. More and more people want to make provision for themselves and we want to encourage them  \nto do that.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "**Supervision and regulation**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "19\\. And if we are to encourage saving we need a regulatory environment that commands the support and respect of the industry and public alike.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "20\\. We promised reform at the election. Four days after the election we gave operational independence to the Bank of England. And three weeks later we set out how we would deliver the radical overhaul to the regulatory system we promised.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "21\\. And, just over a month ago the new Financial Services Authority was launched. It will take over the work of nine existing regulators.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "22\\. In the global economy where markets are changing every day, where innovation and diversity are an essential part, the need for a new regulator that has power and flexibility is essential.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "23\\. For the first time the regulator will have statutory objectives clearly set out. And the authority will to promote a greater understanding of the benefits and risks associated with financial products. The draft financial services Bill, updating and replacing the various pieces of legislation covering financial services, will be published next year for  \nconsultation.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "24\\. If we want to encourage people to save and invest we have to make sure they have the information they need.To have confidence in the regulatory system. That\u2019s good for them and its good for business. Good regulation should be complimentary to the business process.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "**The savings culture**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "25\\. We want to build the savings culture. That is good for individuals. It is good for businesses and is therefore good for the country as a whole.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "26\\. But of course the Government has also to foster the right economic climate to enable businesses and individuals to plan for the long term.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "**The Government\u2019s economic approach  \n**  \n27\\. The world has been transformed over the last few years. We live in a global economy. Industries typically span geographical and political boundaries. No country can go it alone. Our objective is to ensure Britain is equipped to rise to the challenge of the world\u2019s new and fast changing economies.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "28\\. We are determined that this country, the first industrial nation, should be ready and equipped to seize the opportunities and a new global economy where its skills creativity and adaptability will mark us out. And there is a new confidence in Britain today.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "29\\. It\u2019s not the job of the Government to pick winners or to second guess management.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "30\\. But Government must address the fundamental weaknesses that have held us back for too long. Economic instability. Boom and bust. Underinvestment. Productivity up to 20% below that of our competitors. Unemployment and the waste of talent of too many people.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "**The Government\u2019s economic objectives**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "31\\. In the six months since we took office, we have begun to put in place the building blocks we need. To raise the rate of sustainable growth to increase the prosperity of the country, so that everyone can share in higher living standards and greater job opportunities.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "32\\. First, monetary stability and low inflation \u2013 the essential precondition for growth. Good for business, for savers, for those on fixed incomes.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "33\\. We have given operational independence to the Bank of England to set interest rates to achieve the Government\u2019s target for inflation. We have put in place the most open and accountable set of procedures in the world. And already long term interest rates have fallen.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "34\\. Second, fiscal stability. The Chancellor in his Budget in July put in place a deficit reduction plan, cutting the huge burden of debt left by the last Government. We spend 25 billion Pounds a year servicing public debt. More than we spend on schools. And at this stage in the cycle we should not be adding to the country\u2019s debt.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "35\\. Thirdly, the Comprehensive Spending Review which I announced earlier this year will conduct a root and branch examination of the 320 billion Pounds the Government spends: 5000 Pounds for every man, woman and child. It will ensure affordable and sustainable public finances and which will set the spending priorities of this Government, for the rest of this Parliament and beyond.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "36\\. And fourthly, removing barriers to growth. We must expand our economic capacity and create the right climate for high levels of investment. That is why we have reformed the corporation tax system, removing the distortions that hinder long term, high quality investment.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "37\\. In the last Budget we cut corporation tax to the lowest level ever. And we intend to cut the main rate again when ACT is abolished in 1999. This further enhances our position as the country with the lowest rate of corporation tax of any major industrialised country and one of the lowest tax burdens on business.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "38\\. And modernising the welfare state, getting more people back into work. Investing in skills and training. Removing the inflationary pressures that have undermined growth in the past. We have taken the tough decisions. Putting the funding of higher education on a sustainable footing for example. All for the long term good of the country.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "39\\. So the building blocks are there. Stability, sound public finances, removing barriers to growth and a commitment to open markets.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "40\\. This Government is outward looking. We have to be and that has driven our policy in Europe as elsewhere.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "41\\. We are determined to open markets and engage constructively in Europe. Both the Chancellor and the Prime Minister have made it clear that we are determined to put in place the necessary preparations which will allow Britain to decide to join EMU if economic conditions justify it.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "42\\. We\u2019re one of the most open economies in the world \u2013 trading 25 per cent of our GDP compared with America\u2019s 10 per cent. And nearly 60 per cent of our exports are to mainland Europe and an astonishingly high level of international investment into Europe \u2013 30 per cent of it \u2013 comes to the UK.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "43\\. In less than 14 months from now the German business selling products to France and the Netherlands will be able to do so without exchange rate risk, with lower transaction costs and with more transparent prices, something that in itself will be a big challenge to a British competitor hoping to supply the same order.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "44\\. So EMU will lead to fiercer competition for trade and for future investment across Europe. And the time to prepare is now long overdue.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "45\\. We are working with business to prepare for the introduction of the Euro in 1999. The Euro will affect each and every one of us.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "**Preparing for the future**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "46\\. In Europe and at home are objectives to obtain long-term stability. Stability in policy making. Stability in the economy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "47\\. Our pre-Budget report last week marks another innovation. It sets out the major economic issues facing the UK in the run-up to the Budget in the Spring and beyond.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "48\\. In the modern economy, demand for more openness and transparency than in the past. Openness builds confidence in the Government\u2019s ability and determination to maintain economic stability.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "49\\. And we set out clear choices for the country. There is the opportunity now for sustainable growth. Growth that will create job opportunities and generate the wealth this country needs.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "**Conclusion**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "50\\. Tonight sees awards for individuals and business on whose success we all depend. Government\u2019s job is to compliment business effort. To prepare the country for the future. To maintain economic stability. To ensure a skilled and adaptable workforce.To open markets in Europe and elsewhere.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "51\\. But no Government can ever take the place of individual flair. It is that innovation and enterprise that we celebrate tonight.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
