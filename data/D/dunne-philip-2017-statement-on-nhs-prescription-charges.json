        "The prescription charge will increase by 20 pence from \u00a38.40 to \u00a38.60 for each medicine or appliance dispensed. To ensure that those with the greatest need, including patients with long-term conditions, are protected, we have frozen the cost of the prescription prepayment certificates (PPCs) for another year. The 3 month PPC remains at \u00a329.10 and the cost of the annual PPC will stay at \u00a3104, allowing unlimited prescriptions within a specified time period. Taken together, and in the interest of fairness, this means prescription charges are expected to rise broadly in line with inflation.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
