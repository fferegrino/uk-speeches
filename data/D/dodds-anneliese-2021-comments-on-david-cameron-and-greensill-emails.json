        "These emails confirm that Greensill wasn\u2019t shy about the financial trouble it was in last year.

        "This is about keeping public money safe. We need to understand why Greensill Capital was given so much time and access to the Treasury, and why so much public money was put at risk.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The Chancellor must now come clean about his role in the return of Conservative sleaze by urgently publishing details of every call, text and secret meeting he had with David Cameron\u2019s Greensill Capital.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
