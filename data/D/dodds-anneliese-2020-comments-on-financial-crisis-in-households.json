        "Even before coronavirus hit, many families in the UK were living on the breadline and this report confirms that the crisis has only made things worse. A third of all adults had no savings going into this crisis, and we now see that millions of families have been forced into debt.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Sadly the government\u2019s action only risks making this worse. Rather than targeting support to where it is needed most, as Labour has called for, the government is insisting on a one-size-fits-all withdrawal that will plunge us deeper into a jobs crisis and force even more people into dire financial straits. They must change course.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Over the longer-term, the Government must look at why so many families lack financial resilience in the first place, tackling insecure jobs and poverty wages and providing a proper safety net by replacing Universal Credit.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
