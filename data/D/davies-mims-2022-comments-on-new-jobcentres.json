It was great meeting our Work Coaches and colleagues from Instant who have been integral in getting our new sites up and running and fitting out these new modern environments to make a positive difference to the lives of so many people.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "This opening marks the completion of our expansion programme with 194 additional Jobcentres now open across Great Britain to support the impact of the pandemic and help people progress. We are getting jobseekers into the record number of vacancies while also supporting those in low paid work to be able to increase their hours, to earn more and move forward in their career.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
