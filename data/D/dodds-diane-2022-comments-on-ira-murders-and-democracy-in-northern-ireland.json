        "In Christmas 1996 the IRA came into the Royal Victoria Children\u2019s hospital to murder my husband and I as we sat by our son\u2019s bedside. It\u2019s high time Michelle O\u2019Neill and Mary Lou McDonald accepted there was an alternative to unleashing gunmen in a children\u2019s hospital and condemned the murderous and reckless act.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The DUP made clear there was no basis for government last February when we were the largest party. Unlike Sinn Fein we have always respected the ballot box and the rule of law.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The DUP accepts the last election result but rejects the NI Protocol that Sinn Fein wants rigorously implemented. False claims about the last election come straight from the Sinn Fein textbook of lying about political opponents.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Stormont can only function with unionists and nationalists so until the Protocol is sorted there is no solid basis for moving forward.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
