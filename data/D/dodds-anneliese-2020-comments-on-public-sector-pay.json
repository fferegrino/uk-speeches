        "The Conservatives froze public sector pay for seven long years, and the rises they introduced after that failed to plug the gap.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "A pay rise for our police, nurses and teachers now is good news, but for many frontline workers it still won\u2019t make up for a decade of real terms pay cuts.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "And many other public sector workers \u2013 including those working on the front line in social care \u2013 won\u2019t get a pay rise out of this at all because the Tories haven\u2019t made good on their promises to boost local authority funding.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "That\u2019s not fair \u2013 and it\u2019s no way to reward those who\u2019ve been at the forefront of fighting this pandemic.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
