        "This latest u-turn from Rishi Sunak shows why his Budget was so short-sighted. The Chancellor\u2019s last-minute changes to rates relief just kicked the can down the road and caused more confusion for British business.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Now he\u2019s had to go back to the drawing board yet again, while businesses are left counting the cost of more chopping and changing from this Chancellor.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "On Monday, Labour called on the Government to reform the business rates system to level the playing field between high street businesses and online giants, but it ducked that decision again.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "While the Conservative Government wrings its hands and fails to act, Labour has pledged to put communities first and deliver a bright future for our high streets.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
