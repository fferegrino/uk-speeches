        "I have been warning for months and months that the Chancellor\u2019s one-size-fits-all withdrawal of furlough support was a recipe for a jobs disaster this autumn. I gave the Chancellor 40 chances to u-turn on this, and 20 times his Government ruled out any change.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "I gave the Chancellor solutions too. In May I said we should be considering a flexible, short hours scheme. In August I told the Chancellor to look to countries like Germany which already have such schemes up and running. And just this week I put forward Labour\u2019s plan for a Job Recovery Scheme that would allow businesses to bring back staff on reduced hours.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Time and time again the Chancellor failed to listen, and now tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs. Too slow on lockdown, too slow on testing, too slow on schools \u2013 and too slow to protect jobs.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
