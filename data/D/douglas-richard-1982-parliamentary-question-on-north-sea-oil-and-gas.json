        "It is expected that by the end of 1984, 25 oilfields and seven gas fields will be in production in the United Kingdom section of the North Sea.

        "I thank the Minister for that reply. Is there not a danger that, unless we get a reasonable and sensible policy, we shall become net oil importers by the late 1980s?

However, it is true to say that probably no other industry has a closer dialogue with the Government than the oil industry.
