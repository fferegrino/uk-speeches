        "One of my very first engagements when I became as Secretary of State two years ago was to launch DECC\u2019s Energy Efficiency Deployment Office.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "I said then that one of the purposes of EEDO was to \u201cchange the way we think about energy\u2026\u2026to make energy efficiency real and relevant to people\u2019s everyday lives\u201d.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
