        "People looking after their loved ones are doing a remarkable job, often in very difficult circumstances. This is something I know all too well, as a carer for most of my life \u2013 first for my mum, then for my gran, and now for my disabled son, John.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "This year, we mark the theme of Caring Costs. It\u2019s clear that Caring Costs in so many ways, whether it\u2019s emotional or financial. Especially in light of the cost of living crisis.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Up and down the country, family carers are facing huge pressures. Soaring energy costs and fuel prices can make it difficult to undertake their caring responsibilities. At the same time, many carers are struggling to juggle paid work with their caring responsibilities. And Carer\u2019s Allowance remains the lowest benefit of its kind, at just \u00a369.70 a week.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "But yet again, the Conservatives are completely ignoring family carers. They were left out of the \u00a3650 Cost of Living Payment \u2013 and have even seen their support slashed by \u00a3207 this year, once soaring inflation is factored in.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Our carers deserve so much better than this. That\u2019s why Liberal Democrats are calling on the Conservatives to extend their \u00a3650 Cost of Living Payment to all those on Carer\u2019s Allowance. And we will keep campaigning to increase Carer\u2019s Allowance by \u00a31000 each year.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Carers and their loved ones desperately need extra support this winter. And Liberal Democrats will keep fighting for them.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
