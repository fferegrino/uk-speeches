    "content": [
        "The UK had the worst recession of any major economy when the crisis hit \u2013 and now we know it had the weakest growth of any major economy through 2020 as well. Given these awful figures, the Chancellor should be supporting families through this crisis. Instead, he\u2019s hitting them with a triple hammer blow to their pockets of pay freezes, council tax hikes and social security cuts. This economically illiterate approach will harm our recovery and lead to long-term scarring.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
