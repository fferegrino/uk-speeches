        "This is no April Fool \u2013 the Chancellor really has decided to hit the lowest paid furloughed workers with a pay freeze in the middle of a pandemic. That\u2019s on top of his real-terms pay cuts for our NHS Covid heroes, his massive hike in council tax for families across the country and his plans to slash Universal Credit in just a few months.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Hitting Britain\u2019s families in their pockets isn\u2019t just wrong \u2013 it\u2019s economically illiterate. If families have less money to spend, then businesses will suffer and the recovery will take longer. That\u2019s the cost of the Conservatives.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
