        "**Introduction**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "\u2018Getting on with it\u2019 is the title of this conference and that is exactly what I want to talk about today. It\u2019s what your customers expect from you. And bluntly it\u2019s what the public tell us too.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "I\u2019ve been impressed at how much enthusiasm there is to work together. And importantly an enthusiasm to get on with it. That\u2019s in all our interests. Industry. Government. And most crucially the passengers.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Today is not for analysing how we got where we are. Rather we need to focus on how progress is made from now on. Towards a better and safer railway.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "To allow plenty of time for questions, I shall be brief. In following weeks and months I\u2019ll set out in more detail how I believe we should take things forward from here. And at the same time, I\u2019ll address important wider issues such as the critical balance between road and rail and how we get that right.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "You asked me to set out my first thoughts in relation to the railway. Today I\u2019ve got three things I want to say:\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "First, we must to build from where we are\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Second, you need to work together, and we with you.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "And third, the industry must look at things through the eyes of its customers, the travelling public.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "**Focus on delivering existing strategy**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "I\u2019m clear the first priority must be to deliver existing objectives. So let\u2019s concentrate on making improvements where they are needed most. We need to convert the very substantial funding going into transport through the 10 Year Plan into visible results and improvements year on year.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The day I got this job I said I would take a good look at all the Department\u2019s work. That\u2019s what you would expect. But I also said that I had no intention of tearing up the 10-Year Plan and starting from scratch again.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Just as economic stability is essential for businesses to plan investment with confidence. So we need stable transport policies.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Of course we\u2019ll improve on the plan. It will undoubtedly need further development. And we\u2019ll do it. But the immediate need is to get on and see visible progress as quickly as possible.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The railways have been through a difficult time. The legacy of years of under investment are very apparent.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "And all this alongside the public rightly demanding better standards means there is a lot to be done. And the public is rightly impatient for change.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Now there are successes. In my first few weeks I have been struck by what is being achieved:\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "4000 new carriages on order or delivered\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "A substantial increase in freight and passenger numbers over the last 5 years\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "And construction of the first new major railway for over 100 years ( the Channel Tunnel Rail Link) now on time and on budget\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "We need to build on these. A clear programme delivering improvements across the whole network.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Last week\u2019s announcement which will lead to the setting up of Network Rail was crucial to get the network on to a sound footing. And I\u2019m grateful for the welcome most of you gave it. It marks a new spirit of co-operation, working together.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "**Work together**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Which brings me to my second point. \u2018Getting on with it\u2019 means working together. The fragmentation and lack of common purpose that characterised the railway system in the past few years has been damaging and destructive to the interests of both the industry and the travelling public.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "As many of you recognise, the industry needs to work together. In the same direction with a shared objective. Sorting out the small problems as well as the bigger ones. And you\u2019ll have our support.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "And the Department will always be open to new ideas and approaches. Not just from industry but user groups and the wider public. If there\u2019s a case for change or a new approach, let\u2019s discuss it. But always remembering the key thing is to get on with the job in hand.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Progress is being made. I am encouraged the industry is now working together far more closely than in the past. In particular, I welcome the good relations between the Rail Regulator and the Strategic Rail Authority, Railtrack and the operating companies.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "With the setting up of Network Rail, there\u2019s been some comment about what this means for the relationship between Government and the industry. Of course it\u2019s Government\u2019s job to put the right structures in place and secure the funding we need. But let\u2019s be clear about this: it\u2019s your job to manage and to deliver.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The Strategic Rail Authority has already brought coherence to long-term planning. As well as a clear commitment to getting results. The new management is making a real difference\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Network Rail will operate in the public interest. But it needs to driven by sound commercial decision-making. It must have a firm control over its costs, its assets and its contractors.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Through the 10 Year Plan, we are providing the funding to put right decades of under-investment. But we will not write blank cheques. You\u2019ve got to show results.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The Train Operating Companies need to bring in the flair and efficiency they promised. And they can point to some successes \u2013 new rolling stock for example. But there are still problems to be overcome. Operating Companies account for half the network\u2019s delays.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "For the railways to work, everyone has to work together. I want to say a word about contractors and subcontrators in that context. This is a big issue. A problem we know needs to be sorted out.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Now there always have been subcontractors in the industry. That\u2019s not the problem. Rather the problem is that in too many cases not enough attention is being paid to making sure subcontractors do what they are supposed to do.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "And what is imperative for safety also makes good sense commercially.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "So what\u2019s needed urgently is end to end accountability. And it isn\u2019t enough to put in place processes \u2013 ticking boxes to show the process has been followed. Checks are needed to see they\u2019ve actually done what they are supposed to do. Safety is of paramount importance.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "We\u2019ll play our part. I am going to publish proposals for a new independent Rail Accident Investigation Branch later this month. Setting up for the first time in the railway\u2019s history, an independent railway investigator whose sole focus is to establish the causes of accidents and to learn lessons.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "**Look outwards and improve**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "This brings me to my third and final point. The industry needs to look out at the railways through the eyes of its customers \u2013 both passengers and freight.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Customers are concerned about results. They want to see trains running on time. They are concerned about safety. And they want to travel in comfort. This is not rocket science. And it\u2019s within our grasp. We just need to do it.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "But there\u2019s more to it than that. People should use the railway because they want to. Not because they have to. As an industry you should set high standards for yourselves. We need more innovation. We need to give the customer proper choice. Reflecting the way they want to travel. Easy to book tickets which are easily changed.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The railways have been about for a long time. But the industry needs the vigour and imagination of a new industry.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "We can learn from the way newer industries have responded to the demands of their customers. You face different problems. So your solutions will be different. But be creative. Show some flair.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Stand in your customers\u2019 shoes. Ask yourselves what matters to them. Services should centre around the customer. Not shoe-horn customers into operational convenience. Or because it\u2019s always been done that way.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "We must set our sights on a railway network that is consistently reliable and accessible to its passengers. It will take time. We\u2019re making up for years of under investment. The approach is changing. There is the beginning of a new culture of co-operation which should deliver year by year improvement. Putting it bluntly, there\u2019s a lot more to be done.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "**Conclusion**\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "That\u2019s all I want to say today. There will be more in months to come. But I said I would give you my first thoughts. We build on what\u2019s been achieved. And work together. And we put ourselves in the passengers\u2019 shoes . If we do that I believe we can make a real difference to the railways in this country.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
