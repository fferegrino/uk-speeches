        "This is a real disappointment, given the Conservatives had suggested they would be accelerating the Future Homes Standard.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "The Government is already seriously behind on our climate targets. Cancelling Labour\u2019s Zero Carbon Homes policy in 2015 wasted years of progress.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "To rebuild our country from Covid, we should be building homes now that are affordable to heat and durable for the future. This announcement sets out four more years of delay, which isn\u2019t good for families, builders or the environment.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
