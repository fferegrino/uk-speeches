        "The mask slipped for Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives at this month\u2019s Budget. It was the moment it became clear they want a return to the same weak foundations that led to the worst economic crisis of any major economy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "Instead of rewarding all NHS workers with the fair pay rise they deserved, the Chancellor hit them with a real-terms pay cut. Labour won\u2019t stand for this shabby treatment of our Covid heroes, so we will use every parliamentary opportunity to force the Conservatives to reverse this insult.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",
        "When Labour clapped for our carers during the pandemic, we meant it. That\u2019s why we won\u2019t rest until all our brave NHS staff get the fair, long-term, pay settlement they deserve.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
