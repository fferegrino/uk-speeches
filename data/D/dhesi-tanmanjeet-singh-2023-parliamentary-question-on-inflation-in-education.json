        "Schools, like families and businesses across the world, are facing global inflationary pressures. The Prime Minister has pledged to halve inflation, and school funding will increase by \u00a32 billion next year as well as the year after that. This will be the highest real-terms spending on schools in history, totalling \u00a358.8 billion by 2024-25. In 2010, school funding stood at \u00a335 billion, so we will be delivering a 68% increase in cash terms. The Government have also announced further support for parents worth \u00a326 billion next year.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "In addition to having grave concerns about recruiting and retaining teachers, schools in Slough and across our country continue to struggle with their budgets, with a quarter of primary school senior leaders reporting that they have had to cut outings and trips due to budgetary constraints. How will the Government ensure that children do not miss out on these vital opportunities?\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product",

        "The autumn statement announced significant additional investment in core schools funding. The core schools budget will increase by \u00a32 billion in 2023-24 and 2024-25. That will be paid into schools\u2019 bank accounts in April, and I am sure they will welcome that additional funding.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product"
