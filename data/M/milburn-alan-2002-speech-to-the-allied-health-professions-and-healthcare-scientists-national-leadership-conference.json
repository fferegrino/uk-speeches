        "For me an NHS that is funded by all and used by all makes for a stronger society for all. I think the values of the NHS are the values of our nation -fairness and equality, compassion and community, a belief that we can achieve more together than we ever can alone. And that these values \u2013 far from being the backward looking sentimentalism that our critics claim \u2013 are actually grounded in the needs of our society today. The case for collective provision of health care in my view has never been more compelling. Health is not just another commodity. It cannot be bought and sold in a market place. By definition our need for health care is unpredictable. And today the sophistication of modern treatments can put individual provision of health care beyond the reach of all but the very wealthiest in society. My very strong personal belief is that the ill paying to be ill is not the right way forward for Britain.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education",

        "Our opponents would like to pretend that the NHS is a bottomless pit. That isn\u2019t true. What is true is that it will take time for improvement to fully come through. The NHS Plan is a ten-year programme not a programme for one or two years. But where we have put resources in it produces real results. You can see that in heart services for example. A year ago people were waiting up to 18 months for an operation. By the end of this month the maximum waiting time for a heart operation will be 12 months \u2013 still too long but moving decisively in the right direction. In primary care the prescribing of cholesterol lowering drugs is up by one third in just one year. 1,000 GP surgeries are being modernised. The biggest hospital building programme is underway.
