        "I said three years ago that more spending on medicines is, in my view, a good thing, not a bad thing. Provided of course that the extra money is spent effectively and gets good value. Some feared, three years ago, that the advent of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence \u2013 and I pay tribute tonight to its work under the leadership of Sir Michael Rawlins \u2013 would act as a brake on drug spending in the NHS. Those who thought that obviously got the wrong pedal. NICE has not slowed down expenditure on new drugs. It has accelerated it. NICE decisions since it was set up three years ago have cost the NHS over \u00a3700 million. Amongst those benefiting have been an additional 31,000 cancer patients, 160,000 diabetes patients, 100,000 people suffering from alzheimers disease and 170,000 more who can benefit from atypical antipsychotic drugs. In the last year alone, as John said, prescribing of statins has risen by 30% benefiting over one million people and helping to save an estimated 6,000 lives.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education",

        "And over time I would expect to see the importance of medicines to the NHS continuing to grow. And in all likelihood drugs spending as a proportion of NHS spending will also continue to grow. Too much of the debate on health care today in my view is still focussed on the narrow terrain of hospital-based activity. Now what happens in hospitals is, of course, incredibly important. But it is not the be-all-and-end-all of what the health service does. Indeed changes in demography and the pattern of illness alongside scientific advance and technological breakthroughs are driving the NHS towards more health care being delivered in a non-hospital setting. As today\u2019s World Cancer Report from the WHO argues, the focus increasingly needs to be on prevention, not just treatment. The work we have done together in government and the industry has given the NHS a world-leading smoking cessation service sets a course which we must now follow in the years to come.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education",

        "New challenges then, demand new approaches. And here there are good reasons to be optimistic. Indeed, some commentators say we are likely to see in the next twenty years as much advance in healthcare as we have seen in the last two hundred. The pharmaceutical industry will undoubtedly be at the leading edge of these advances. Day by day the industry is helping us understand disease mechanisms better. And many believe this generation, our generation, stands on the threshold, fifty years after DNA was first decoded at Cambridge, of a genetics revolution that could transform health care across the world. Pharmocogenetics that tailor drug treatments to individual patient metabolisms. New drugs and therapies targeted at the cause of the disease rather than controlling its symptoms. Diagnostic methods that can help prevent disease before it develops. And gene therapies that hold out the prospect for entirely new treatments \u2013 and even cures \u2013 for cancer and other common diseases.
