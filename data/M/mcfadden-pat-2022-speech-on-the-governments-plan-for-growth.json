We have heard many powerful speeches about the impact of inflation and rising energy costs, the pressures on business, the UK\u2019s international reputation and the impact of rising mortgage rates. If you will forgive me, however, Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to single out the speech of the hon.

        "This country has been through very significant economic damage in recent weeks: a run on the pound, a spike in gilt yields that has increased the cost of Government borrowing, emergency interventions from the Bank of England to prop up the country\u2019s pension system, and a spike in mortgage rates that will add to the household costs of millions of people to years to come. All of it has been self-inflicted\u2014not an act of God, not the result of global conditions, but the result of using the country for an ideological experiment. To deal with the argument that the Financial Secretary made at the beginning of the debate\u2014essentially, that this is all global\u2014I will quote from a letter from the Bank of England to the Treasury Committee.
