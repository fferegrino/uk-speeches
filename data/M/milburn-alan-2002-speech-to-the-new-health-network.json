        "European insurance-based systems, cited so approvingly by some, are not without their problems either. Ironically, while some in Britain are looking to Europe for the answer, the experience in Europe over recent decades has actually been in the opposite direction \u2013 away from insurance towards tax-based systems driven by concerns about the scale of the funding burden placed on employers and employees. The real cost and complexity of a wholesale introduction of a new funding regime in Britain would be years of turbulence and instability.

        "Local services will operate within the context of clearly defined national standards. Intervention will be limited. It will be in inverse proportion to success.

In those local services where there are persistent problems \u2013 which are more often than not organisational and cultural \u2013 the management could be franchised. Within this new definition of the NHS, the franchise could go not just to another public sector health organisation but in time to a not-for-profit body such as a university or a charity or to some other external management team. As franchising progresses it is possible to imagine a number of local health organisations all being run by a single team of successful public service entrepreneurs. The assets, of course, of the franchised local hospital or PCT will remain within public ownership. It is the management that will be franchised.

We will look to establish similar ventures in the future both from the domestic independent sector and from the sector in other parts of Europe that may wish to establish a presence in England. Like the use by the NHS of spare capacity in private hospitals this is all about expanding the volume of care available to NHS patients. There is no blank cheque.
