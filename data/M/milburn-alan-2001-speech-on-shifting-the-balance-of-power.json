He comes with a track record of delivering impressive changes in those NHS organisations he has run. Now he has an even bigger job. One that sounds seductively simple in theory but is fiendishly difficult in practice.

The Agency is already supporting 30,000 clinicians and managers to make change happen: to raise standards of service and improve access to services.

Earlier this year I set out in a speech how reform must fundamentally change the relationship between patients and the service.
