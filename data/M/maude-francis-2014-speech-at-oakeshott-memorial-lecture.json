        "Why? Because creating a mutual releases creative energy and entrepreneurialism. And that\u2019s the problem many critics have with this programme. They either don\u2019t believe entrepreneurs exist in the public sector. That it\u2019s solely the domain of stuffy bureaucrats. Or they don\u2019t think entrepreneurialism should be allowed to mix with the public service ethos, lest it contaminates the purity of this ethos. Both I believe are wrong. There are loads of latent entrepreneurs in the public sector.

        "On the other hand does mutualisation by negotiation frustrate competition? Well actually not at all. It promotes it. It opens it up a broader hybrid economy with a wider range of suppliers \u2013 there\u2019s a place for mutual spinouts, joint ventures and charities and voluntary organisations, alongside private companies and the public sector. So it\u2019s just worth asking ourselves why is such a small proportion of public service delivered by suppliers outside the public sector? Because I think part of it is conventional outsourcing and privatisation is fraught with political and industrial relations risk. It can look ideological and dogmatic, and can arouse the hostility of the staff.

        "So support for employee ownership across both sectors has been and will remain a priority for this government and a core part of our long-term economic plan, a point reinforced by the Chancellor in last week\u2019s Budget, which confirmed 3 new tax reliefs to encourage and promote employee ownership; I\u2019m sure you all look forward to seeing more detail on these in the Finance Bill being published I think later this week. This had a nostalgic resonance for me. I recall as Financial Secretary to the Treasury working on the tax measures to support employee ownership that appeared in the 1991 Budget!
