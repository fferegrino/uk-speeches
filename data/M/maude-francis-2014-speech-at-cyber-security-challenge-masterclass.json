And were they computer scientists or mathematicians? No, they were ancient historians. One of them produced a classic work on ancient Rome. What was needed was brainpower: sheer, intellectual brainpower. The ability to process difficult things and make sense of things that didn\u2019t seem to make sense.

        "On a visit a year or so ago, I remember meeting a young apprentice at a small cyber company in Malvern where, rather improbably, there is this cluster of cyber security related businesses. Not where you\u2019d expect to find it \u2013 but great. And this young man who was 16, starting his apprenticeship, he\u2019d been thrown out of school. He wasn\u2019t succeeding academically, it wasn\u2019t his thing. He was disruptive at school and they\u2019d bunged him out. But he loved computers, he loved doing this stuff and was brilliant at it \u2013 and he\u2019s found his niche. And I remember asking him how many like you were there in your school \u2013 and he replied about half the class. That\u2019s quite a rich talent pool to draw from and are we getting as good as we need to be at spotting that raw talent and using it? Helping people find their niche, the thing they\u2019re brilliant at.
