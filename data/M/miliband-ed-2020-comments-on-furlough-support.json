        "Businesses in vastly different sectors and circumstances should not be treated in this uniform way, and it is clearly unfair and illogical for those employers still locked down and unable to trade.

        "Labour is calling on the Government to end their damaging blanket approach to ending furlough support before it is too late, and to target support at the hardest hit sectors.
