    "content": [
        "On Thursday, 30th May 1895, as reported in the Redditch Indicator, one Thomas Woodward, agricultural labourer, of Red Lion Street, Redditch was admitted as the first patient to the recently opened Smallwood Hospital, Redditch. I assure the Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security, for whose presence I am grateful, that I do not intend to set out the whole history of the difficulties besetting the provision of a casualty service in Redditch since that date. But it is significant that the first patient admitted was a casualty patient, there having previously been some argument as to whether a hospital was needed there for that purpose.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education",
        "The Minister may be familiar with the argument about whether a new district general hospital was required in my constituency at all, an argument happily concluded. But the hon. Gentleman will not be surprised to learn that even with the construction of the Smallwood hospital there was an argument for about three years over the choice of the site, and there was some delay in the construction. All that my constituents are hoping is that \u200b the new hospital will be open well before the centenary of the Smallwood hospital.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education",

        "The truth is that we are confronted with a log jam. My purpose in raising the matter this afternoon is to seek the Minister\u2019s assistance in attempting to break it. I hope that he will understand me when I say that it is also my intention to try to head off the possibility of a witch-hunt being conducted locally, in the press and by other means, against those who are imagined to be responsible for the difficulties affecting the provision of the casualty service. Such a public witch-hunt could only do serious damage to the morale of those who are continuing to provide the greatly reduced service and could well result in the complete withdrawal of the service.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education",

        "The new town of Redditch now has a population of about 60,000. According to the statistics handed to me last week by the local employment office, there is a workforce of 33,000, practically all in manufacturing industry. The casualty service does not just provide for the growing new town of Redditch. It also provides for the surrounding areas.

        "The population of the area currently served by the Redditch casualty service, restricted as it unfortunately is, is about 90,000 and is increasing as the new town moves towards fulfilment in 1981. During the discussions we have had on several \u200b occasions with the Department, mention has been made of the need for this service. The Under-Secretary referred to this in his letter to me of 19th August 1977. The area health authority was asked to undertake a survey at that time. A year later an interim survey was produced.

        "It can be said that the figure for the number of casualties from Redditch attending the Selly Oak hospital out of normal working hours, which are the only hours during which the Redditch service is provided\u2014this can therefore be taken as a fair indicator of the increase in demand and consequently of the need\u2014 have risen from 13 per month in 1976 to 145 per month last year.

        "There is also a query about the extent of the treatment accorded to these casualties from Redditch at Selly Oak hospital. The question that arises is whether they are given full treatment or some first aid attention and then referred to the Redditch hospital during working hours on Monday for a full and proper examination. I am not qualified to speculate on that but I would point out that it is not unknown for there to be 110 cases awaiting the magic hour of 9 o\u2019clock on Monday morning in Redditch.

        "During that period of warning notice, there had been attempts to try to resolve the situation. The suggestion was made that the practitioners providing the service might qualify for the newly-constituted grade the previous year\u20141975\u2014 of hospital practitioner. This was found to be out of order on what appears to the layman to be the technicality that a consultant was not in overall charge. I say that it appears to be a technicality to the layman because consultants do provide a specialist consultant service on a sessional basis at the hospital.
