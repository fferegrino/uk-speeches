        "Today I want to outline the Government\u2019s approach. Let me say at the outset that partnerships between the public sector and the private sector are a cornerstone of the Government\u2019s modernisation programme for Britain. They are central to our drive to modernise our key public services.

        "I say that for two principal reasons. Firstly, because they are necessary. PPPs make possible more investment in our key public services after years of systematic under-investment. Over the last Parliament (and over the last cycle) public sector net investment fell by 1 per cent of GDP (and by 2 and a quarter per cent of GDP between 1979 and 1997.) This government believes in our public services. We believe in the values of public services and in the staff who deliver them. We believe too that they can be better than much of the private sector. But we also believe that they have to dramatically improve their productivity, their efficiency and their performance. Indeed this government was elected with a mandate not just to save services like the NHS but to modernise them too.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education",
        "To do so we have launched the most far-reaching programme of reform our public services have ever seen. And we have matched our commitment to deliver significant improvements by putting our money where our mouths are. Not only record extra cash for hospitals and schools but record levels of investment as well to modernise the fabric of our country. After years in which public sector infrastructure was allowed to deteriorate we are doubling public sector net investment in Britain\u2019s infrastructure over the next three years. An extra \u00a312.5 billion of public money going into the fabric of our hospitals, schools, transport and other services to begin the process of modernisation that is so long overdue. Our ambition is to close the all too clear gap that exists between the quality of our public sector buildings and facilities and those of the private sector. We are harnessing private sector capital to help us bridge that gap. But whilst the previous Government sought to use private investment as an alternative to public investment, this Government is using private capital as an addition to public investment.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education",
        "The principal means of this extra investment has been the Private Finance Initiative. Since the election we have signed \u00a34 billion of PFI deals and we have got PFI working in sectors like health where it has not worked before. 31 major hospital developments worth almost \u00a33 billion are in the pipeline. The biggest new hospital building programme in the history of the NHS. We are now seeing the benefits of private sector investment spread too into other parts of the public services such as schools and colleges. By the end of this year we estimate that private sector investment in PFI projects will account for around 14% of overall public sector investment. By the end of this Parliament we aim to have signed PFI deals worth \u00a312 billion. That of course is on top of the direct up front investment we are making available through Exchequer capital. All of this investment is necessary \u2013 and not just because the public has a right to first class services \u2013 but because in a fast moving world public services will not be able to keep pace unless they are capable of investing in the modern technologies. New IT systems in particular will help deliver quicker, better and more integrated services.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education",

        "The changed world in which public services operate demands the marrying of private sector and public sector skills if modernisation is to deliver the responsive convenient quality services people need. Today\u2019s public services were designed at a time when needs were more uniform than they are today and users were less vocal. Mass produced services for an era of mass production. Today people rightly expect public services to be tailored to their needs, delivered efficiently and to the highest standards. We pay for insurance over the phone so we expect to be able to do the same with our council tax. We shop at all times of the day and night and we expect the same 24 hour access to our health services.

        "Harnessing the commercial consumer orientated management skills of the private sector then will help in the public service modernisation process. But what is more the public sector needs other private sector skills if it is to successfully meet the challenges it faces. It needs commercial expertise to help manage the enormous and complex investment process that is now underway in IT, in transport and in other services across the public sector. By introducing private sector investors who put up their own capital, skills and experience, the public sector gets the benefit of commercial disciplines, innovations and efficiencies. The result is not only better services but better value for money too. Prisons built through PFI that brings savings of 10%. Defence training projects delivering savings of up to 15%. IT in schools delivering savings of up to 30%.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education",
        "Under PPPs the public sector specifies the outputs required from new investment but the responsibility for and, crucially, the risks associated with delivering those outputs is transferred to the private sector.

        "In some areas the private sector is best able to provide the services. In others the public sector is in the best position. In the case of the health service for example clinical services are best delivered by public sector staff not least because the NHS is more efficient than the private sector alternative. But in many cases the best way forward is through new partnerships between the public and the private sectors. Where each brings something to the table.

        "We have developed new levers to bring about these reforms. League tables. Inspections. Targets. Sanctions. Rewards. Partnerships between the public sector and the private sector are a further lever for change. They are part and parcel of our new modernisation approach. And to ensure that PPPs such as the PFI are capable of playing a key role in the modernisation process we have instituted a radical reform programme. We have done so too in part to address some of the failings we inherited in the PFI. There have been over 250 successful PFI deals. But of course a few have run into difficulty. No one should underestimate the complexity of the investment programme we are taking forward in our public services. Often there are individual projects running into hundreds of millions if not billions of pounds. Those who think that partnership is easy have got it wrong. It isn\u2019t \u2013 but the prize on offer is enormous providing the private sector and the public sector can develop a shared understanding to overcome what can be very different cultures and ways of operating.

In place of the previous Government\u2019s use of PFI as a battering ram for the privatisation of public services the changes we have made allow us now to use it to drive forward their modernisation\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education",

        "Differences in structure reflect different objectives and different circumstances. We are using PPPs, where it is appropriate to do so, to ensure that public services are freed from the straight jacket of monopoly control whether by the private sector or the public sector. That means tailoring solutions to solve specific problems. I can tell you today that later this year I will be publishing a prospectus setting out the range of partnerships that the Government is seeking to develop with the private sector. Already we have put in place a range of partnership structures. Commercial freedoms for state owned enterprises, joint ventures, the sweating of public assets, leasing, strategic equity partnerships, minority share sales, concession arrangements, as well, of course as the PFI itself. So while we are committed to making the PFI work even better not all of our eggs will be in the PFI basket. Again for us what counts is what works.
