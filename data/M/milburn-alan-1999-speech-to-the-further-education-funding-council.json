I hope it will see the further education sector picking up the opportunities afforded by the Private Finance Initiative.

        "This is what the PFI offers. A better deal for taxpayers and better services for the public. Since we came to office in May 1997, we have revitalised PFI so that today we can rightly say that it is a key tool in helping provide effective and good value public services. Since the election, we have signed \u00a34 billion worth of PFI deals and we have got PFI working in sectors like health where it had not worked before. We are now seeing its benefits spread to other parts of the public services such as schools and colleges. In your own sector, further education, the 7 signed projects alone have a capital value of \u00a337m, and there is also much PFI and PPP activity in the Higher Education and Schools sectors. By the end of this year, we estimate private sector investment in PFI projects will account for around 14% of overall public sector investment. Accompanying this turnaround has been a tremendous upsurge in confidence both in the public and private sectors that PFI can deliver the goods.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education",

We have acted to improve confidence too among the local staff and local communities involved with PFI deals.

PFI should not be a secret process because it is about providing better services to the public. We have published guidelines for the consultation of staff and other interested bodies. We have taken action to give a fairer deal on pensions for staff transferring between the public and private sectors as part of a PFI deal. And we have made it clear that is no longer a requirement for staff providing soft facilities management services, in hospitals for example, to have to transfer at all.  \nJust a fortnight ago we also resolved the thorny issue of the accounting treatment of PFI deals. The new guidance that we published will provide a platform of certainty for PFI in the future.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education",

That is why with the impending expiry of the Taskforce\u2019s 2 year mandate this summer, we asked Sir Malcolm Bates to take a second look at the PFI and public private partnerships more generally to see how the government could further improve our approach.

        "In the meantime I can tell you that the PFI reform process will take another step forward tomorrow when the Treasury Taskforce launches its guidance on the Standardisation of PFI Contracts. Consultation with hundreds of interested parties has produced guidance which provides the public sector with a practical toolkit for delivering the very best value to the taxpayer. The guidance will avoid the pitfalls of the past \u2013 where the public sector, let alone those in the private sector, have had to re-invent the wheel at considerable expense every time a hospital or a college entered into a PFI arrangement. Standardised contracts will take time the effort and expense out of doing PFI deals.

        "The new guidance will do something else too. It will end once and for all the argument that PFI is about mortgaging the future. Nothing could be further from the truth. PFI is about securing a better future. It does so by providing modern high quality public service facilities for staff and public alike. Assets built through the PFI already come complete with a money-back guarantee of quality through the life of the contract. Unlike conventional procurement, PFI provides a legal guarantee that facilities are maintained as new. That is one of the great advantages of PFI. Nor is it true \u2013 as some have alleged \u2013 that PFI is just a rental scheme where the public sector pays money out but gets nothing back.

        "Now though the new guidance makes it clear that this should be the norm where it is in the public sector\u2019s interest to do so and where there is no alternative use for the asset. In the future, where it is appropriate, ownership of assets built through the Private Finance Initiative will revert to the public sector at the end of the PFI contract. This further reform to the PFI will guarantee that the taxpayer inherits top quality fully maintained schools, hospitals and colleges capable of serving local communities for many years to come.
