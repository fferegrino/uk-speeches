        "Labour has long called for investment in high ambition, high risk science.

        "But Government must urgently clarify the mission and mandate of this new organisation, following strong engagement with the UK\u2019s science base \u2013 those closest to the work.

        "Many researchers have been hit hard during the crisis but have been excluded from government support, and there is still no clarity about what the science budget will be in just six weeks time and where it will be spent, leaving the industry in limbo.
