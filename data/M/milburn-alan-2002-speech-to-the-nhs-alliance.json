        "Our country\u2019s family doctors are the backbone of the NHS \u2013 and the service they provide is not just valued by patients in this country it is envied in other countries across the world. So when some newspapers imply that the NHS is full of bad doctors let us just so this: it is full of good doctors doing their best for patients. And good nurses, therapists, administrators and professionals helping provide care for one million patients every day. I believe it is time that we as country said that we are proud of the work that you do.

        "Such a proposal can only succeed if the NHS fails. So the stakes are high for all of us who believe in the values of the NHS.

        "But in the end I believe the biggest difference will be made by giving GPs better control over their working lives and greater ownership over the process of change. And this is where PCTs have such a crucial role to play. Just as we are devolving power and resources from Whitehall to local PCTs so local PCTs need to devolve to local practices. The PCTs need to get practices and clinicians \u2013 nurses as well as doctors \u2013 involved in reshaping local services. Every time I visit a practice and speak to a GP or a practice nurse what strikes me most is their absolute determination to raise standards in order to provide the highest quality services to their patients. Our job \u2013 together \u2013 is to harness that commitment. If we do it will not be \u201cmeltdown\u201d for primary care.
