        "Unlike the existing contract, however, where there are automatic increases in salary, in future consultants extra earnings will be dependent for the first time on performance against agreed job plans. The job plan will set out how consultants time should be best used for the benefit of NHS patients. It will secure more face to face sessions with patients with an increase in the time consultants spend on direct clinical care. The current system of fixed and flexible sessions will go to be replaced with a new system in which NHS work is timetabled and typically carried out on site with no non-NHS work permitted during this time. The old NHS working week of 9-5 will also go. Instead NHS employers will be able to schedule consultants work and pay for it at standard NHS rates between the hours of 8am to 10pm Monday to Friday and 9am to 1pm at weekends. This new system of flexible working will be good for both consultants and for patients. As we expand consultant numbers it will make for more efficient and productive use of NHS facilities \u2013 such as operating theatres \u2013 that could otherwise lie idle.

        "For the first time it will be explicitly part of the consultants contract of employment that NHS patients come first and the NHS always has first call on consultants time. It does this first of all, by giving exclusive use to the NHS of up to 48 hours of a newly qualified consultants time each week \u2013 the maximum the NHS could demand under the Working Time Directive. Under the new contract this exclusive use of newly qualified consultants time will apply for the first seven years of their careers, as we proposed in the NHS Plan. Secondly, the new contract goes further than the NHS Plan because any consultant wanting to undertake work on privately paying patients after seven years of NHS service will need to give the NHS an extra session of four hours a week at normal NHS pay rates. Thirdly, new rules on private practice will set out how NHS commitments must always take precedence over private work with adherence to these new rules enforceable as part of the new contract.
