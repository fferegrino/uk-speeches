        "We have to embark upon legal reform, whether driven by Europe or by financial challenges. For that reason we will take action to make whatever changes are necessary once Lord Carloway returns with his report on criminal procedure. We will take action to protect the integrity of our legal aid system in a time of austerity. We will ensure protection for those who need it most. However, the days of the victim of domestic violence having to contribute to the cost of getting protective orders whilst the perpetrator got criminal legal aid with no contribution have to change.
