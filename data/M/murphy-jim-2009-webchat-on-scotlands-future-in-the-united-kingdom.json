        "Support for Scotland staying part of the UK has increased in recent months. It seems that the longer the current administration in the Scottish Government are in power the lower the support for their policy of separation becomes. If there were ever to be a referendum the polls show that most Scots support Scotland remaining part of the Union.

        "**Jim replies:** We made a mistake in making the job of Secretary of State for Scotland a part time role. Wales and Northern Ireland have full time Cabinet Ministers and Scotland is no less important than Wales and Northern Ireland. At a time of the recession it is crucial that Scotland has a voice in the Cabinet speaking up for Scotland. But ultimately it\u2019s not for me to decide the value of the role. It\u2019s for the people of Scotland.

        "**JIM LAMB:** I would like to see Scotland along with Wales And Northern Ireland.Go COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT from England.That means that they pay thier own pensions,social security payments,medical care,education.EVERYTHING A independent country has to pay for it\u2019s OWN people.A mirgration system set up that a visa would have to be sort for people that want to live or work in England.But would exclude any unemployment or social bennifits. All health care would have to be paid for.This would apply to ALL imigrants to England.The English people are fed up of having to pay taxes to countries in this so called United Kingdom,that want independece,but still want billions of assistance from England.What free education does Scotland boast about,when the English pay for it?And when Scots go to English uni\u2019s they get it free.When English students go to uni\u2019s in Scotland they have to pay.That is rubbish and needs to stop.The English people want to be COMPLETLY INDEPENDENT,the United Kingdom needs to be disbanded as soon as possible.James A Lamb.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: United Nations Climate Change Conference (Conference of Parties)\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education\n  *[ODA]: Official Development Assistance\n  *[NGOs]: non-governmental organisations\n  *[NGO]: non-governmental organisation\n  *[BII]: British Investment International\n  *[DFID]: Department for International Development\n  *[UKEF]: UK Export Finance\n  *[COPs]: *[COP]: United Nations Climate Change Conferences\n  *[UNGA]: United Nations General Assembly\n  *[IDA]: International Development Association\n  *[IBRD]: International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n  *[IFC]: International Finance Corporation\n  *[IDA20]: World Bank launched an early twentieth replenishment process of the International Development Association\n  *[SDG]: Sustainable Development Goal\n  *[GRF]: Global Refugee Forum\n  *[SAF]: Sudanese Armed Forces\n  *[RSF]: Rapid Support Forces\n  *[EBacc]: English Baccalaureate",

        "**Adam Lipman:** Why should Scotland leave the union? Do you not believe it is beneficial for the whole country, not just Scotland, to stay together. After all the investment and subsidies the UK as a whole has put into Scotland, you want to leave when time get a little tough. I heard Alex talking about North Sea oil? one trillion pounds worth. The UK, not Scotland, pumped huge amounts of money into exploration and drilling for this oil. Why does Scotland deserve this when it is just about to dry up? Does your party only focus on the 5 million people who live just over the border, who have been treated very well since the union was formed or do they even consider the 50 million souls just south of the border?

But in government you have got to try to design a system which provides help and support to those who need it.

The big question is how do you support those who are willing to return home voluntarily and that is what we are trying to do.
