        "The district health authority has problems of staffing, but it is difficult to be sure what form those problems take. For example, the district health authority suggests that it wishes to phase out a particular grade of specialist in the maternity and gynaecological unit, but when I questioned the Department on that matter, I found that it was not \u200b Department policy for that particular grade to be phased out. Staffing problems are indicative of financial problems. Since 1982, the district health authority has had its budget reduced by \u00a32\u00b75 million\u20145 per cent.

        "Over the period 1984 to 1993 there is a planned reduction for the regional health authority in the long-term resource allocation. All of those cuts will mean not only the disappearance of the maternity unit at Orsett hospital, but the ear, nose and throat, children\u2019s services, pre-convalescent geriatric services, cuts in the family planning service and other general cuts. Those cuts are being made in an area which is growing. At present the need for maternity units at Basildon and Orsett hospitals is based on population figures that are somewhat out of date. In fact, the area is developing pretty rapidly. In Thurrock, my constituency, the number of houses has already increased substantially, and most of them are occupied by young families, many of whom will have children in future years. That feature of the area has been picked up by the local press.

        "I also wish to refer to the accident and emergency unit. I have, of course, discussed the matter with the district health authority, including the district manager, Mr. Taylor. He has given me assurances that the district health authority has committed itself to two-centre planning for accident and emergency units\u2014one at Basildon and one at Orsett. In my view, those two units are essential not only because of the population, but because of the serious risks from the industry in the area. Thurrock, in particular, is noted for oil refineries, power stations, petrochemicals and the docks, and the M25 and the dualled A13 are extremely busy roads.

The original hospital for Thurrock was in Tilbury, in the docks area. It was brought into being by public subscription. Eventually that hospital became out of date and was transferred to a new building at Orsett. The hospital is very much the result of past community effort.
