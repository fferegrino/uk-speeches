        "But the Treasury\u2019s role in Parliament was not confined to personnel. Until the 17th century, Parliament\u2019s role was to agree to taxes, often to finance war. But the King had considerable freedom to spend the revenue pretty much how he wanted. The Civil War, Restoration and Glorious Revolution changed all that. Again, it was the ubiquitous Downing who was the author of a change in procedure, introducing the principle of \u201cappropriation of supply\u201d. He persuaded Charles II to incorporate in the bill which sought to finance the Dutch war in 1665 a provision appropriating the \u00a31\u00bc million exclusively for the pursuit of the war, and through the rest of Charles\u2019 reign this became a device which increasingly curbed the royal prerogative. Admittedly, it took time for the principle of appropriation to become embedded, largely because expenditure financed by the Civil List \u2013 which included the small domestic departments of Whitehall as well as the King\u2019s personal expenses \u2013 remained outside the system of annual votes. However, during the course of the 18th century Parliament steadily chipped away at the Civil List, with the result that more and more expenditure became subject to annual votes. By the time William IV came to the throne in 1830, the Civil List only covered the expenses of the Royal Household. More recently, the Sovereign Grant Act of 2011 completed the process by bringing financial support to the Royal Household into annual estimates for the first time.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence\n  *[ABI]: Association of British Insurers\n  *[CMU]: Capital Markets Union\n  *[IMO]: International Maritime Organization\n  *[MARPOL]: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[IGF]: International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels\n  *[COP]: Paris Climate Conference\n  *[AOA]: The Airport Operators Association\n  *[BATA]: British Air Transport Association\n  *[OECD]: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[PISA]: Programme for International Student Assessment\n  *[PIRLS]: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study\n  *[TIMSS]: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n  *[DCMS]: Department for Digital Culture Media & Sport\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[HR]: human resources\n  *[NASBM]: National Association of School Business Management\n  *[CAMHS]: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services\n  *[EPPSE]: Effective pre-school, primary and secondary education\n  *[LAs]: local authorities\n  *[PVIs]: private, voluntary and independents\n  *[UNDP]: United Nations Development Programme\n  *[BIT]: Behavioural Insights Team\n  *[QOF]: Quality Outcomes Framework\n  *[\n  NICs\n ]: National Insurance Contributions\n  *[UKTI]: UK Trade and Investment\n  *[IPOs]: initial public offerings\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education\n  *[FSM]: free school meals\n  *[RAISEonline]: Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self Evaluation Online\n  *[GSHA]: Grammar School Heads Association\n  *[OSA]: Office of the Schools Adjudicator\n  *[LACA]: Leading Association for Catering in Education",

        "It was Gladstone who commissioned the Northcote-Trevelyan report of 1854 which ushered in recruitment by open competition and promotion on merit. Indeed, it was Gladstone who pressed Trevelyan to recommend open competition when his early drafts showed signs of compromising on this principle. Not for the last time in Whitehall, there was considerable foot-dragging about implementation \u2013 between 1854 and 1868 only six departments made use of open competition in relation to 28 posts in all. But Gladstone\u2019s Chancellor, Robert Lowe gave it renewed impetus in the late 1860s. According to Hennessy. Lowe was \u201ca tormented soul \u2026 [whose] deeply unappealing manner and striking albino appearance had not endeared him to his contemporaries\u201d. Nevertheless, he insisted that all Treasury posts were open to competition and sought to impose the same principle on all other departments, though the Foreign Office and Home Office exempted themselves on the grounds that performance in those departments hinged on character and not intellect. And other departments like the Department for Education failed to honour the agreement. And so the Treasury tended to be the main beneficiary of a reformed university system. This resulted in the Treasury attracting a more able \u2013 though not a more diverse \u2013 intake.

        "In 1861, Gladstone set up the House of Commons Select Committee on Public Accounts \u2013 a crucial ally to the Treasury in ensuring that public money is spent wisely and as Parliament intended. And the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act of 1866 brought together the procedures of Estimates, Appropriation, Expenditure and Audit into one coherent system. The inefficient and unwieldy Exchequer was finally swallowed up by a strengthened Audit Office under an independent Comptroller and Auditor General. In 1872, the Treasury introduced the system whereby permanent heads of departments would be nominated as \u2018Accounting Officers\u2019: they would sign off the Appropriation Accounts submitted to the Comptroller & Auditor General in effect taking responsibility for the economy and efficiency of spending, as well as accounting accuracy. And, although there were subsequent attempts to diminish the role of the Accounting Officer, for example by making the Principal Finance Officer rather than the Permanent Secretary responsible, the Treasury has always resisted any change to the core principles of the Accounting Officer regime.

        "I would argue that the Treasury of today is much more strategic. It tends to work through others. For example, it sets the monetary policy target. It delegates its operationalisation to the Bank of England. It determines the regulatory framework, but delegates its operation to the FSA soon to be succeeded by the Prudential Regulatory Authority at the Bank. It sets the public expenditure totals: it falls to the departments and the Cabinet Office through the Efficiency and Reform Group to drive forward the efficiency improvements necessary to maintain services at a time of falling public spending. It determines that there should be two economic and fiscal forecasts a year. But it leaves it to an independent Office of Budget Responsibility to provide them. Growth policy is developed in partnership with the Department of Business and others, and operationalised through a number of departments and agencies. Indeed, it has no choice if the Treasury is to remain a lean and agile department of around 1000 officials.
