She always looked forward to the royal week in Edinburgh each year. Scotland was, as she described it, her \u201cspecial place\u201d.

Her name is on dozens of plaques and buildings all over my constituency and tens of thousands all over the country. She embodied what it means to be British and epitomised public duty, decency and dignity.
