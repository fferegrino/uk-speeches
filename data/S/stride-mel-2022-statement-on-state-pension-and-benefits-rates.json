        "The Social Security Administration Act 1992 places an annual statutory duty on the Secretary of State to review the rates of state pensions and benefits after consideration of trends in price and earnings growth in the preceding year.

        "I have decided that state pension and benefit rates should increase in line with the consumer prices index (CPI) for the year to September 2022.

        "I will deposit the full list of the new rates in the Libraries of both Houses in due course, but I am pleased to announce here the increases to some of the largest benefits. The full rate of the new state pension will increase from \u00a3185.15 to \u00a3203.85 a week. The basic state pension will increase from \u00a3141.85 to \u00a3156.20 a week.

The universal credit standard allowance for a couple where one or both are over 25 will increase from \u00a3525.72 to \u00a3578.82 a month; the limited capability for work and work-related activity amount will increase from \u00a3354.28 to \u00a3390.06 a month; and the child element for those born on or after 6 April 2017 will increase from \u00a3244.58 to \u00a3269.58 a month.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
        "This decision will increase expenditure on state pensions and pensioner benefits by \u00a313 billion in 2023-24 compared to no change in these rates for the same period. It will meet the Government\u2019s manifesto commitment to apply the triple lock to the new and basic state pensions.
