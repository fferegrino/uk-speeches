        "Too many innocent civilians have lost their lives to these weapons of war.

        "Every step taken under this Convention, makes the world a safer place \u2013 but too many states still refuse to give up cluster munitions.

        "We did so on behalf of the parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions.
