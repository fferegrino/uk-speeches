        "Thank you, Nick, and my congratulations as well on your OBE, and all you\u2019re doing on climate action.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So, friends, I joined last year to close London Climate Action Week.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And that week, you\u2019ll remember, saw a number of important announcements made, including the launch of the Net Zero Lawyers Alliance, and the expansion of the Powering Past Coal Alliance.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So, it is a real pleasure to be joining you again, and I very much hope we end this week with further, more ambitious commitments.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And it\u2019s great to see so many climate leaders coming together.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And as Nick has said, it\u2019s leaders from across London\u2019s government, business, youth, and civil society communities.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Each of you squarely focused on how this brilliant city can be at the heart of tackling the climate crisis.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That, for me, is leadership on climate action.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Now, I understand that today\u2019s first panel event will ask a simple, but actually vitally important question, which is:\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u201cAre Glasgow\u2019s Promises Being Delivered?\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It is the question that drives me forward, literally every waking hour, this year, during our COP Presidency year.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "If I look back to November, the Glasgow Climate Pact was forged, under the UK\u2019s stewardship, between almost 200 countries.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And it sets a path to a clean global future.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And I do think Glasgow was historic.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Because based on the commitments made in that Pact, and indeed through commitments outside the negotiating rooms as well, which some of you will have been involved in, we were able to say with credibility that we kept alive the prospect of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "As a result of the work done in the lead up to COP26, we\u2019ve now got 90 percent of the global economy now covered by net zero targets.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "When we took up the mantle of organising COP26, that was less than 30 percent.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Glasgow Pact calls on countries to revisit and strengthen their 2030 emissions reduction targets, as necessary, to align with the Paris temperature goal, and to do that by the end of this year.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It urges developed countries to scale-up climate finance, and specifically to double finance for adaptation by 2025.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And it underlines the importance of adaptation, the dangers of loss and damage, and the need to scale-up action and support for both, whilst, at the same time, charting a way forward to do so.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Of course, we have to recognise the Glasgow Climate Pact has a whole range of other things it addressed, but I wanted to highlight the key ones.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And of course, the world has changed markedly in the months since COP26.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We meet against the backdrop of multiple global crises, much precipitated by the Putin regime\u2019s illegal, brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And even as we deal with these challenges, the evidence on climate is unequivocal.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The chronic threat of climate change is getting worse. That is what the science tells us.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Climate impacts are compounding existing vulnerabilities, food, water, migration-related issues.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Loss and damage is already occurring.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Millions of lives and livelihoods are being affected.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The one thing we have begun to understand as a result of Putin\u2019s war, is that it amplifies the fact that climate and environmental security are totally interlinked, and are synonymous with energy and national security.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It is clear that the window of time we have left to act is closing.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And, frankly, it is closing fast.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It is critical, therefore, really critical, that we turn the commitments we made in Glasgow into action.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We have seen some progress made since COP26, on the commitments made in Glasgow.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So, what\u2019s the progress?\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I think we\u2019ve seen some. I\u2019ll go over some of the areas where we have.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "13 new Nationally Determined Contributions, including one recently from our friends in Australia.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "At the May Ministerial meeting I co-chaired in Copenhagen, bringing together almost 50 governments,\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I have to say, I was encouraged by some of the statements made by countries looking actively at revisiting their NDC.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We\u2019ve also had seven countries set out plans to revisit their emissions reduction targets at the recent Major Economies Forum, chaired by the US.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We\u2019ve got 51 long-term strategies have now been submitted to the UNFCCC, including a number since Glasgow.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "More than 2.5 billion people are now covered by adaptation plans.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And work is being done to scale up finance, and, through the Access to Finance Taskforce co-chaired by the UK and Fiji, we are working to make sure that the finance can reach the climate vulnerable countries that need it most.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We also saw progress on key work programmes at the intersessionals in Bonn this month.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So, if I were to sum all this up, Nick, I\u2019d say the scorecard on the Glasgow Climate Pact reads: some progress made, but a lot more to do.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And we need to quicken the pace.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Every country must respond to the call to revisit and strengthen their NDC, and actually, particularly the G20, which, as we know, are collectively responsible for 80% of global emissions.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "They must do so not at some vague point in the future, but by September 23rd this year, which is the deadline set by the UNFCCC.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And more countries of course need to come forward to submit long-term strategies by that deadline too.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And the reasons for this are that NDCs have to be backed by credible policies that deliver on the commitments made in Glasgow.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "From commitments on coal and cars, to trees and methane, to an acceleration of the shift to renewables, as well as the move to clean technologies, which are at the heart of the Glasgow Breakthrough Agenda, which we launched at COP26.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We also need developed countries and other climate finance providers to ensure that finance flows to national and local adaptation priorities, supporting developing nations\u2019 ambitions.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And that means further progress on delivering the $100 billion a year, and, of course, on the commitment to double adaptation finance to $40 billion by 2025.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This was a commitment made at COP and we have to honour it.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We must also get the Santiago Network operationalised by the time we get to COP27, and show progress on work on the Global Goal on Adaptation, and the Glasgow Dialogue on loss and damage.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This may sound like a really large programme of work.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But it is what we agreed on delivering in Glasgow.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And, in some respects, this is just the start.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Looking ahead to COP27, and, indeed, beyond, we need to see faster progress on mobilising the trillions needed to put the world on a more sustainable footing.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So, that means, finance for developing countries.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "For critical sectors.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "For clean technologies.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Finance for our Just Energy Transition Partnerships too, such as the one we agreed for South Africa at COP26.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And these JETPs, as we call them, are mechanisms that tailor support to individual developing countries\u2019 energy transitions, helping to deliver national plans that keep the lights and the factories running, whilst at the same time driving progress towards a clean energy transition.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And, at the same time, supporting the very many thousands of people, who currently rely on fossil fuels for a living, to reskill and retrain.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And I have to say that, done right, these partnerships will have a profound impact around the world.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Just last week, I was in South Africa, and I had the opportunity to meet many Cabinet ministers, but I also met current miners and mining trade unions.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Their testimony was powerful.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It is vital that the transition to clean energy is done in a managed way, which protects livelihoods and provides retraining opportunities, and jobs for affected workers.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Above all, and I\u2019m just being very frank about this, this is not about flicking a switch overnight.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It is about a carefully managed transition.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So, on JETPs, and across all the issues I have touched on here, we must continue to make progress.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And I am going to be using the remaining months of our COP26 Presidency to urge further action, through the G7, the G20, at the UN General Assembly, and during the second Climate and Development Ministerial in September, which the UK is going to be hosting in the margins of UNGA.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "None of this work can be done without cities, local authorities, businesses, young people, and civil society by our side, making their own commitments, and driving us on.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Look at London.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This is a city which is, in very many ways, a big international powerhouse.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It provides the UK with huge social, economic, and cultural energy.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But as we are recognising through this gathering, the city is also responsible for a significant portion of total UK emissions.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So there is clearly work to be done.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And I am pleased that today\u2019s second panel, which is looking specifically at London\u2019s transition, and how to address this whole issue head on.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "There is already progress to report.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "For example, and you will know this, London is now ranked first on the Global Green Finance Index, an initiative that evaluates the green finance offerings of 80 major financial centres around the world.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And the Government is providing funding to support the UK Cities Climate Investment Commission, helping to mobilise finance and drive investment into low and net zero carbon emissions projects across London, and across the UK\u2019s largest cities.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But I urge all those with us today to go further.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I urge local leaders to set out the clear steps they will be taking to reach net zero across different areas.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "From housing and transport.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "To planting trees and enhancing nature.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Tackling air pollution, and building green infrastructure.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Frankly, the sort of infrastructure that the Prime Minister championed, during his mayoralty, to make London one of the most cycle-friendly cities in the world.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And, to all those business leaders in the audience, I urge you to recognise that net zero is one of the clearest economic trends there has ever been.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "As I said earlier, 90 percent of the global economy is now covered by net zero targets.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We also know, at COP26, we have financial institutions with over $130 trillion of assets on their balance sheets, many of them actually based in London, have committed to net zero by 2050 through the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The UN-backed Race to Zero campaign, which commits its members to reach net zero by 2050 at the latest, now has 7,500 international businesses, that\u2019s an almost 50 percent increase in the number of businesses since COP26.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And, of course, over 60 percent of UK FTSE100 companies are committed to net zero as part of that effort.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The opportunities this transition presents, for jobs, for investment, and for economic growth, are actually clear.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And frankly the idea that there is a trade-off between climate action and corporate success is increasingly seen as anachronistic.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So, for those of you who have already committed to net zero as part of this effort, I want to thank you, I want to salute you for that, but now is the time to go further and set out clear plans, clear transition plans, for how you will get there.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "For those of you who have not yet committed to net zero, please, just go for it.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "You won\u2019t be disappointed.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It\u2019s going to be good for your bottom line.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Finally, I know there are youth and civil society leaders in the audience today as well.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Your role is absolutely crucial.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I have been clear about that throughout the UK\u2019s COP26 Presidency.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "In fact, we established the COP26 Civil Society and Youth Advisory Council to help shape the Glasgow summit.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And when I\u2019ve gone around the world, I\u2019ve always made an effort to meet youth and civil society groups around the world, and hear their views.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We need your knowledge, your enthusiasm, and your leadership.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We need people who are on-the-ground in their communities, helping to deliver effective local solutions.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And, frankly, we need you to keep up the pressure on governments and businesses to deliver on the commitments they have made.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Between all of us: central and local government, business, youth, civil society,\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "London can continue to be a powerful force for change.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Creating the conditions for ambitious climate action, which is what we need.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So, thank you for your leadership, for using your influence, and for showing how strongly the appetite for climate action exists.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
