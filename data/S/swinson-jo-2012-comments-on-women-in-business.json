        "What women need is confidence, not quotas. So rather than telling companies what to do, we\u2019re encouraging them to see the real business benefits of taking voluntary action. Our approach is beginning to pay off. We have already seen the biggest ever jump in the number of women on boards and it doesn\u2019t stop there. Many of the UK\u2019s leading companies are now reporting on gender equality throughout their workforces under our Think, Act Report scheme and the Women\u2019s Business Council is investigating how to help remove barriers to female success. This ongoing work will help even more women rise to the top and give the economy a real boost.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework"
