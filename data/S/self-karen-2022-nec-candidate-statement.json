        "I joined the Labour Party in 1988 at the peak of Thatcherism, when attacks on worker\u2019s rights and civil liberties were commonplace. I never thought I would see a worse Tory Government, but here we are in 2022 and the right wing extremists are in charge. The folly of Tory Party politics is now laid bare before us, with energy companies failing, a housing crisis, a cost of living crisis and NHS waiting lists at record levels. My Labour Party is one that is inclusive, diverse and representative of our society. I have no time for those who are just here to create division, those who are driven by the purity of their socialism. I am here to make a difference and we can only do that by winning. I believe under Keir Starmer the party has moved in the right direction. I am currently CLP secretary for Bristol North West. In this constituency we know how to win, we did it in 2017 and again in 2019. I will bring a winning mentality to the NEC. I believe in consensus decision making and won\u2019t \u2018throw my toys out of the pram\u2019 if I don\u2019t get my way.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
