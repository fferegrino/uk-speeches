Reveals to me that William Hague will join us if he is to be chairman of the party. We have the makings of a dream ticket. Do we tell Francis Maude, Norman Lamont et al at dinner? No. I leave Howard\u2019s home by pre-arrangement at 9.20pm. I go to a phone box and ask Howard if \u201call clear\u201d. \u201cYes, come back\u201d.
