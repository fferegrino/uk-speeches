        "As a result of quota share uplifts agreed in the trade and co-operation agreement, the UK has around 30,000 tonnes more quota from these negotiations than it would have received with its previous shares as an EU member state. The UK has agreed 69 TACs and arrangements for non-quota stocks with the EU for 2023, providing fishing opportunities of more than 140,000 tonnes.

        "An initial estimate suggests that the number of TACs that align with scientific advice from ICES\u2014the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea\u2014has increased by 13% compared with last year. This is the largest increase since 2020, when the UK first started using this metric.

All TACs are at or below the level advised by ICES. For two stocks\u2014haddock and whiting\u2014the parties have agreed to take a more precautionary approach than the scientific advice to avoid risks to the recovery of North sea cod, given the close interactions between the stocks, and set a 30% increase on each.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance",

We have also agreed to reciprocal access for herring, up to 20,000 tonnes. On exchanges, we secured around \u00a33 million worth of North sea quota from Norway\u2014including valuable stocks such as monkfish\u2014together with around \u00a32 million-worth of stocks in Arctic waters.
