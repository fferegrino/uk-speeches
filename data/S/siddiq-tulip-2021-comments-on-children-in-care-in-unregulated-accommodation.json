        "All children need a safe place to call home, yet some of the most vulnerable are effectively being cast aside because there isn\u2019t enough capacity in the care system.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "After a year of consultation, the Government still hasn\u2019t realised that most looked after children in unregulated accommodation are over 15. Their proposed solution is yet another sticking plaster that won\u2019t address the problem.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We need a clear plan to rebuild children\u2019s social care after this pandemic and ensure that no child is left behind.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
