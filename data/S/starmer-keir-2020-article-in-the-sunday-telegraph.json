        "Let\u2019s Get Brexit Done.

        "I accept that the leave-remain divide is over. The country needs \u2013 and wants \u2013 to move on.

        "It is what the public want, it is what they were promised and it is what they expect to be delivered. I believe a deal is possible too.

        "I am not blind to the fact this could be part of the Government\u2019s negotiating strategy in the final weeks of talks. We were repeatedly told last year that the talks were on the brink of collapse, only for a breakthrough or concession from the Government to come a few days later.

        "However, the decision to propose a Bill last week that would break an international agreement we signed a matter of months ago is wrong. Many former leaders of the Conservative Party have spoken out to say so.

        "First, public trust has been broken. The deal the Prime Minister promised would be done is now being reopened. The divisions within the Conservative Party are being reignited. And at a time when we are all doing everything we can do to follow social distancing rules, ministers are on the television and radio justifying why it is ok for them to break international law.

        "We have broken the trust of our global partners too. I believe we can be a proud nation on the world stage and a moral force for good.

        "The Labour Party I lead will always speak out in the national interest. I want the talks with Europe to succeed.
