        "Capitalising on the networks and relationships at our disposal in this globalised, competitive world will help us all to promote prosperity, stability and security. And the Commonwealth is a long-standing network of old friends which lends itself perfectly to this ambition. Indeed, with 53 members, representing a third of the world\u2019s population and over 1 billion citizens under the age of 25, the Commonwealth itself numbers some of the world\u2019s fastest growing economies: exporting over \u00a32 trillion of goods and services year. 20 percent of export trade within the Commonwealth is, I am told, British.

        "For the UK, we have strengthened our commercial capacity in our High Commissions in Commonwealth countries in Canada, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Mozambique, Ghana, Kenya, Cameroon, Papua New Guinea and Guyana. UK Trade and Investment helps British companies of all sizes do business across the Commonwealth providing the assistance required to expand the already deep business links between us all.
