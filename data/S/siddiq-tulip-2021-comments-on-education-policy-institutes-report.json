        "The Government is clearly failing children with special educational needs and disabilities. Families are facing a postcode lottery, with inconsistent support that is determined by geography and resources rather than the needs of children.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This is unacceptable. Children have been neglected by this Government and action is urgently needed to ensure that every child with SEND receives the individual support they need to succeed at school.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
