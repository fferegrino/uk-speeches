        "The Government has treated children as an afterthought throughout this pandemic. Vulnerable children face greater risks during lockdown, so it is extremely concerning to see this decline in referrals to children\u2019s support services.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Government has clearly not learnt lessons from the first lockdown when many vulnerable children were left without support.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Instead of doing everything possible to identify children at risk of slipping through the gaps, Ministers are turning their backs allowing Government funding for a programme reaching these vulnerable young people to end this month.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
