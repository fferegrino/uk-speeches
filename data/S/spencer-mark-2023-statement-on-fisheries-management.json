        "The UK has some of the finest fish stocks in the world. Healthy fish stocks are a vital resource, providing livelihoods, enjoyment, and prosperity to our coastal communities.

        "As an independent coastal state, we negotiated significant uplifts in fishing opportunities for UK vessels, valued at around \u00a3101 million this year. We are investing in the long-term future of the UK fisheries sector through our \u00a3100 million UK Seafood Fund, to drive innovation, support job creation, and boost seafood exports to new markets.

        "Today we take another step in that journey, unveiling proposals for a reform package that will transform how we manage our fisheries.
