        "The virus is clearly out of control and there\u2019s no good the Prime Minister hinting that further restrictions will come into place in a week, or two or three. That delay has been the source of so many problems. So, I say bring those restrictions in now, national restrictions within the next 24 hours. That has to be the first step in controlling the virus.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
        "On schools, I don\u2019t want to add to the chaos that will be caused by having all schools closed tomorrow, but many will be closed. It is inevitable that more schools will need to close and the Government needs to plan for children\u2019s learning, but also for working parents.

        "The more important thing is that national restrictions need to come in over the next 24 hours.
