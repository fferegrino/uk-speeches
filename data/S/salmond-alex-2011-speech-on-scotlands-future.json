        "Firstly Scotland has many friends internationally. People cheering us on and wanting us to do well. That international reach is a great asset for this country.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Secondly climate change is perhaps the greatest issue facing this planet. The responsibility of the Scottish Parliament for it is almost accidental. It wasn\u2019t even on the agenda back in 1997 and therefore wasn\u2019t specified as reserved in the Scotland Act. As a result it was devolved.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So given that by international acclaim we have handled this mighty issue so well as a parliament, what possible argument could there be that the Scottish Parliament is not capable of discharging ALL of the issues facing the Scottish people.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I also wanted to say a word about Scotland\u2019s late national poet Eddie Morgan. A man whose modesty as an individual was matched by his brilliance as a poet. He didn\u2019t wear his politics on his sleeve but he has left this party a financial legacy which is transformational in its scope, and Angus Robertson will spell that out tomorrow..\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "However his real legacy is to the world in his body of work.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "When I was cutting my teeth in politics in West Lothian the late Billy Wolfe once told me that the SNP stood for two things \u2013 independence for Scotland and home rule for Bo\u2019ness!\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "In reality the SNP does stand for two fundamental aims \u2013 and these are enshrined in our constitution \u2013 independence for Scotland and also the furtherance of all Scottish interests.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "These are our guiding lights and they are equally important because they reflect the reality that our politics are not just constitutional but also people based.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I tried to reflect this on election night when these self same people, the community of the realm of Scotland presented to us the greatest ever mandate of the devolution era \u2013 an absolute majority in a PR system \u2013 a system specifically designed to prevent such a thing ever happening\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Mind you it was designed by the Labour Party so we should not be too surprised that their cunning plan didn\u2019t work.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u201cThe best-laid schemes o\u2019 mice an\u2019 Lord George Robertson gang aft agley.\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "The best Scots term for it would be the common weal.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It does not ignore the fact that sometimes as a Government we have to take sides within Scotland, as well as taking Scotland\u2019s side.Particularly when times are tough we have to ask the rich to help the poor, the strong to help the weak, the powerful to help the powerless.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But we do so in pursuit of the common weal, the community of the realm.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "Some people say tackling these things is unpopular. But the election told us that the people respect and understand that sometimes it takes guts to govern.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But we shall always govern for that common weal..\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "To help family budgets we have frozen the council tax for FOUR years and will continue to freeze it through this coming parliament.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Labour say we shouldn\u2019t do this. Really! And then we would have the same 60 per cent rises as when they were in power.

        "To help family budgets we have held down water rates.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Liberals say that we should privatise water. Really! And then we would have been as powerless to act on water bills as they are right now on energy bills.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "To help family budgets we have abolished prescription charges.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Tories say we shouldn\u2019t do this. Really! Tell that to the 600,000 Scots on incomes of only \u00a316,000 who were forced to pay for their medicine.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
