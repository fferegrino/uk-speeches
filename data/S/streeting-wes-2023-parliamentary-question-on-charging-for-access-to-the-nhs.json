Member for York Central (Rachael Maskell), who spoke earlier, contradicted his point. Not only have the hon. Gentleman\u2019s Front-Bench colleagues contradicted it; even the deputy chair of the British Medical Association has said that Labour\u2019s plan would create higher demand and longer waiting times. I am not surprised that the hon.
