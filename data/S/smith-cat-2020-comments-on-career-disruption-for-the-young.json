        "Young people have been ignored by the Government since long before the coronavirus crisis. After a decade of austerity, young people are facing surging housing prices, stagnating wages, and rising student debt. And the Coronavirus Crisis will only compound and exaggerate these issues.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Many young people find jobs in the hospitality and retail sectors. The Government must use next week to introduce a Back to Work Budget which preserves those jobs, creates new jobs and provides job guarantees for young people to prevent long term unemployment.\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
