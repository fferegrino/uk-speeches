        "On World Mental Health Day, it is important to recognise the virtuous circle between health and work \u2013 we know that giving people the support they need to work is very good for their long term health.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Government\u2019s growth-focused agenda will deliver jobs, higher wages and greater opportunities \u2013 and I am delighted that people who have faced barriers to entering the workforce due to poor mental health will now be able to access support across England.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Helping people access both clinical support for their mental health as well as employment advice gives them the tools they need to get into or return to work. This is vital to helping drive down inactivity and growing our economy so we can deliver more money and support for public services such as these.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
