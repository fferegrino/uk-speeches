        "This day is a day many of us wished would never come, but many of us also believed that it would never happen. I need not remind Members of Her late Majesty\u2019s unwavering service as Britain\u2019s longest-serving monarch; her calmness and stoicism during difficult times; and the continuity and stability she offered our country and our people. She personified the virtues of loyalty and humility, never complaining and setting a towering example for world leaders, future monarchs and ordinary people alike. Her Majesty was the embodiment of our nation\u2019s identity, and for many people she was the United Kingdom, with her uncanny ability to appear unchanging yet also move with the times. She epitomised the concept of a constitutional monarch and took this responsibility incredibly seriously, thus cementing the role of the constitutional monarchy in this country, remaining above politics yet imparting profound wisdom to unnumerable Prime Ministers and parliamentarians over seven decades.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
        "It was not her constitutional link to the lawmakers of this land that made her one of the greatest monarchs in our history, but her affinity with every single man, woman and child in Britain and the Commonwealth. Nowhere was this better exemplified than during her visits, for it was in places such as Rother Valley that Her Majesty excelled. Her visit to Rother Valley in 1977 was an unrivalled success. She was greeted at Maltby Comprehensive School by over 7,000 children from across Rother Valley, and on Maltby fields more than 20 schools and youth organisations put on displays. Countless Rother Valley children would cherish the memories of that visit, but my favourite story is about a 10-year-old girl from Letwell, who was dressed in a purple velvet cloak, holding a plea for the Queen printed on a cardboard sign.

        "As the Queen passed by, she duly obliged. Taking the sign, Her Majesty asked Allison, \u201cSo, you want to be crowned, do you?\u201d Then, carefully picking up the home-made crown, held on a velvet cushion by Allison\u2019s page boy, seven-year-old Mathew Orton, of Woodhouse Mill, Her Majesty regally placed it on Allison\u2019s head, thus crowning her the queen of Aston Fence School.

        "Despite all the grandeur, the pomp and ceremony, and the serious constitutional role that she played, Her Majesty\u2019s most winning qualities were humour, kindness and the famous mischievous twinkle in her eye. She was a cultural icon, but beneath it all, she was the nation\u2019s grandmother. She loved all of us, and was beloved by all of us in return.
