        "**[NB, the numbers on this speech have been distorted and are not available]**\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Conference, this Welfare Reform debate defines the party we are, the values we stand for, and the fight we must win.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Our mission is to win the war on poverty throughout people\u2019s lives.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Tories gave the poorest families just \ufffd a week to cover the cost of a child. Through record increases in child benefit and tax credits, Labour has increased that to \ufffd.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Where the Tories left over 4 million children in families on under \ufffd0 a week Labour has cut that by one and a half million.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But it\u2019s right that as Labour\u2019s most ambitious goal we want to see not just fewer children in poverty, but no child in poverty.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It\u2019s about more than income alone. It\u2019s about education, housing, and health, with freedom from crime, drugs and abuse. Sure Start is transforming the life chances of Britain\u2019s poorest children.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Giving children the best start also means helping hard working parents. Eight times as many people are getting help with their childcare than under the Tories, with the new tax credits giving up to \ufffd0 a week for childcare.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But we need to make more places available. It\u2019s ridiculous that so many school buildings stand empty after hours and in the holidays.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So conference, I can announce today that from April we will offer in 3 areas school-based childcare -available 7 to 7, 50 weeks a year, to ensure good care for children and the chance to work for parents.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We will also pilot payments to help lone parents move into work \u2013 an extra \ufffd a week to look for a job and an extra \ufffd a week when they get one.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Conference, we will keep driving forward with welfare to work. It\u2019s one of Labour\u2019s greatest achievements that even in a turbulent world with unemployment rising elsewhere, Britain has not only more people in work than ever before but the lowest unemployment for a generation.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That is not down to chance but to the choices of a Labour Government committed to economic stability and active steps to help people into jobs. It\u2019s not something to be taken for granted.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Britain must never go back to those Tory days where three million unemployed were their \u201cprice worth paying\u201d with the young condemned to idleness and older workers thrown on the scrapheap.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So where the Lib Dems and Tories would axe the New Deal, Labour will extend it, with extra help for those who need it most, because we are determined to achieve our goal of full employment in every region.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That means removing barriers which still stand in the way of ethnic minorities. We must ensure that training recruitment, and promotion depend on ability and not the colour of people\u2019s skin. We will challenge racial disadvantage and racism wherever it occurs so that full employment really does mean employment for all.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That also means helping the million disabled people who want to work. This month we start new programmes combining focussed help in finding work, better NHS rehabilitation and extra payments of \ufffd a week for those who get jobs.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "If everyone is to make the most of their potential, we must change the whole approach to disability from one based on what people can\u2019t do to one based on what they can.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Disability rights is about more than jobs. It is about people\u2019s equal worth as individuals so they are not disabled by the preconceptions of others.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "In years to come the treatment of disabled people typical of the last century \u2013 and still too often the case today \u2013 will be seen as an affront to their humanity.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This is a great cause of emancipation of our time. Labour wants Britain to lead the world on the rights and opportunities of disabled people. We will extend anti-discrimination law and publish this year a Draft Bill, to fulfil in this Parliament our manifesto pledge to the full civil rights of disabled people.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Thanks to health and safety reps and workplace partnership, industrial deaths were down 10% last year. But we must do more. I am announcing today a new Challenge Fund, working with unions and employers, to extend workplace safety advice in small and medium size businesses, and we support the Freedom from Fear campaign, because we believe every worker has the right to workplace safety.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "As people live longer, opportunities for older workers are critical.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "1.2 million more people over the age of 50 are now in work than in 1997 but too many still face barriers. For young and old alike it is wrong to base opportunities on age rather than aptitude and it\u2019s right that we press ahead to outlaw age discrimination.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Our pensions consultation shows that people want flexible options for retirement.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We will change the rules so people can draw down a pension and continue working for the same employer.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Where people choose to take their state pension later, they deserve a better deal.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So I announce today, we will offer people the choice \u2013 for the first time ever \u2013 of a lump sum, as much as \ufffd,000 where they defer for 5 years. So poorer pensioners can get sums which until now have been the preserve of the better off.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We are giving people more choices. But it would be wrong to force longer working on the least well off, often with the hardest working lives and the shortest retirement to look forward to. We reject putting up the State Pension Age.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Conference, partnership should be the basis for security in occupational pensions.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We have set up the Pension Commission; it\u2019s work will include the case for greater compulsion.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "While we applaud those employers taking tough decisions to meet their pension commitments, we condemn those who walk away from their responsibilities, short-changing workers who saved all their lives. They can\u2019t claim workers\u2019 loyalty, then dump them in retirement. Labour is in government not just to challenge such injustice but to do something about it.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So we will change the law \u2026\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u2013 To stop employers walking away from their obligations.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u2013 To stop companies using take-overs to scrap pensions; and,\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u2013 To stop firms changing schemes without consultation\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "A pension promise made must be a pension promise honoured. When a firm goes bust, it can\u2019t be right that workers see their life savings destroyed. So, conference, our Labour Government will legislate for a Pension Protection Fund\u2026\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We build on the improvements we have already made \u2013\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u2013 with the state second pension, extending pension rights to 20 million low paid workers, carers and disabled people, most of them women\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u2013 free TV licences for the over 75s; and\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u2013 the winter fuel payment, going up to \ufffd0 for the over 80s.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And where the Tories want to privatise the state pension, Labour has increased it by \ufffda week more than inflation and will continue to build on it as the foundation of security in retirement.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Labour has already raised the incomes of the 2 million poorest pensioners by more than \ufffd a week, narrowing the gap between them and the society as a whole.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But the system has until now penalised those who\u2019ve put something by for their retirement, with each pound of income knocked straight off benefits.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "On Monday we change that. The new Pension Credit \u2013 the most significant increase in help for a generation \u2013 not only guarantees a minimum income but rewards those who have saved and so often missed out in the past.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It is straightforward, awards are backdated and half of pensioner households \u2013 the poorest half \u2013 gain, by an average of \ufffd0 a year.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "From next week \u2013 as the Tories debate privatising state pensions \u2013 already more than 1 million pensioners will see their income rise with Pension Credit and that number will go up with every passing day.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It\u2019s a key dividing line for the next General Election. The Tories and Lib Dems will have to explain why they plan to take \ufffd0 off half the pensioner households in the country.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So let us get out there, campaigning to ensure pensioners get, and keep, what is rightfully theirs.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And let\u2019s thank all the staff of the new Pensions Service, the first ever dedicated service for pensioners, just as we value all the New Deal Personal Advisors, the Disability employment workers and the child support staff. They are the front line troops in the war against poverty \u2013 and we\u2019re proud of them.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u2013 progress on full employment,\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u2013 child and pensioner poverty,\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u2013 occupational pensions, and tackling discrimination\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u2013 it all shows the difference Labour is making \u2013 and how much more Labour can do.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So let\u2019s go from here proud of our achievements, clear in our vision, confident in our purpose to build a Britain of fairness and opportunity, where no-one is left behind.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The campaign for social justice is at Labour\u2019s heart. It\u2019s what brought all of us into the Labour Party. It is changing Britain for the better and it will be our inspiration until the job is done.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
