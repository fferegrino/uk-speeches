        "I want to use this opportunity to extend my gratitude for the huge contribution the Sikh community has made during the pandemic. Gurdwaras and Sikh organisations have looked after their local communities and those most vulnerable in our society. Even when Gurdwaras were closed for worship, volunteers went in to prepare langar and thereafter delivered free warm meals for people in the community. Sikhs have also been on the frontline as key workers, who have been the backbone of our nation.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
        "We owe a huge debt of gratitude to the Sikh community in exemplifying the core teachings of Guru Nanak.
