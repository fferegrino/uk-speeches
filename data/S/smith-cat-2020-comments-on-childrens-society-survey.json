        "The Government must address the growing mental health crisis faced by so many young people during Covid-19. This new report reveals the extent that parents anticipate long term negative impacts on their children\u2019s happiness.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Whilst the Government\u2019s focus on jobs and upskilling young people is welcome, this cannot come at the expense of vital mental health and wellbeing services. The Government must take the Children Society\u2019s recommendations seriously and provide immediate mental health support to young people and families who need it.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
