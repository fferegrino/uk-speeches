        "Since the heartbreaking news yesterday that simply took my breath away, I have been reflecting on the influence that the Queen had on me and many people across the world. All my life, I have known the legacy that she has given us. All of my life, I have admired this amazing woman, and today my heart is so sad to say goodbye to her. She was universally our Queen, she cared passionately for us all and truly embodied what it means to serve. She promised to devote her whole life to serving her people, and her generous heart never missed a beat. It was a heart of compassion, love and kindness. Through joyous and turbulent times\u2014so difficult that I can hardly imagine it\u2014she carried herself with grace and dignity, a role model for future generations, just like the generation of my wonderful grand-daughter. She was the very best of all of us\u2014the very best of humanity: strong, yet compassionate; loving and steadfast. She laughed with us as a country, her fantastic smile lighting up our lives. She mourned with us, and led us through the darkest of times: a great diplomat, leader, mother, wife, grandmother and great-grandmother and, like me, an animal lover.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance",
