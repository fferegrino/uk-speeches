        "Children seem to have been an afterthought in the Government\u2019s response to this pandemic. We knew that young people would be among the most vulnerable in lockdown, so their wellbeing should have been one of the top priorities from the start.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Labour and the children\u2019s sector have warned for months about the need to prepare for an increase in demand for children\u2019s social care and mental health services. Despite these warnings, it\u2019s not clear that Ministers have a plan to protect those children who need it most.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Government must start prioritising the wellbeing of children and make sure the services that support them are properly funded.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
