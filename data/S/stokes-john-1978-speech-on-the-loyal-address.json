        "It seems quite a long time now since I heard the Gracious Speech read over six hours ago.

        "I found it hard to reconcile the complacent tone of the Gracious Speech with the state of affairs in the country today. I wish to speak with extreme seriousness for a few moments, quite broadly, on the present state of our country.
