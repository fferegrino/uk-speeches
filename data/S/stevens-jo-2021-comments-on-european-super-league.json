        "Proposals for a breakaway league are nothing short of an attempt to stitch up competition for a few elite clubs at the top.

        "This must now be a watershed moment. We cannot simply go back to the status quo in which smaller clubs struggle to stay afloat and fans are excluded from decisions.
