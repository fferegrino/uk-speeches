        "This change from Europe is disappointing especially in these tough times when budgets are stretched. Insurers have no choice but to comply with the European Court of Justice\u2019s ruling, but it means that for car insurance women are likely to face higher premiums and it could hit young women drivers particularly hard. So my message to women is simple: don\u2019t take this lying down. Do your homework, shop around and nail the best deals. For motor insurance, new drivers might also consider taking extra qualifications like Pass Plus which can build driving confidence and cut insurance costs, and telematics policies which reward good driving behaviours with lower premiums.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework"
