        "The images that have been circulating on social media are shameful. But these revelations about the Government\u2019s own guidance means that ministers\u2019 newfound concern rings hollow. A couple of tins and a bottle of milk isn\u2019t the difference between acceptable or unacceptable.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Government\u2019s response has yet again been far too slow, with national food vouchers only becoming available from next week \u2013 two weeks after schools moved to remote learning.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
