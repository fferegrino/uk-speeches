        "From our roads to the skies, the transition to zero emission transport has reached a tipping point. We know that transport plays a key role saving the planet from warming above 1.5\u00b0C, which is why this is the COP that will kick start our ambition for zero emission aviation and why I\u2019m proud to be uniting world leaders to tackle climate change \u2013 creating new opportunities for clean growth, green jobs and improved air quality right across the globe.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "To support the transition to EVs, it\u2019s integral that we have the infrastructure to support it. My vision is for the UK to have one of the best EV infrastructure networks in the world, with excellent British design at its heart.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
