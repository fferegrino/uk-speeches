        "There are more than a few pinch points in our sectors including workforce shortages, capacity pressures, and places for children with the most complex needs.

        "Over the last year we have published [reports highlighting the serious impact the pandemic has had on some of the youngest children](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/ofsted-education-recovery-series).

        "There is also a challenging backdrop as the early years sector adapts to the post-pandemic landscape. Parents are struggling to find childcare that is flexible to their needs and at a price they can afford. Alongside this, many workers are leaving the sector and those who stay are often struggling on low wages, exacerbated by significant rises in the cost of living. Making childcare affordable, while attracting well trained and motivated staff is incredibly difficult.

        "Coming out of the pandemic, schools and nurseries told us they wanted stability and continuity, including in the inspection model.
