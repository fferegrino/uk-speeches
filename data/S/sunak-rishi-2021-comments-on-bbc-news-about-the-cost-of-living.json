        "Well, first of all, I talked about it right at the beginning of the budget speech to provide people some context, explanation and reassurance about what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s largely the result of two global forces, one, the rapid reopening of economies putting pressure on supply chains, but also what\u2019s happening with energy prices. Now, I mean, I wish I could wave a magic wand and make these global problems disappear overnight, but I can\u2019t, so I wanted to be upfront with people about that. These practices are going to be with us for a little while, but people should have reassurance that because of the plans we put in place a year ago to ensure that our economy now is recovering strongly, more people in work and wages are rising. We can face the future with a bit more confidence. And yesterday we did take action, and noticeably we froze fuel duty, especially when fuel prices are at almost a 10 year high. But also we cut the tax on the lowest paid people which I think will make an enormous difference.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework"
