        "In October, we were proud to play our role as Presidency. There were obstacles to be overcome. But with courage and flexibility we were able to do so. The political leadership shown by all sides that night was crucial. But \u2013 and this is something which I wrote to Omer Sabanci when I first accepted this award \u2013 our success was above all a reflection of Turkey\u2019s own accomplishments over recent years; and an acknowledgement of this country\u2019s future within Europe. In the end, we opened accession talks in October because it was in all our interests to do so \u2013 in Turkey\u2019s interest, in the interest of the European Union as a whole, and of every other individual state.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",

I applaud Turkey for the contribution it is playing in difficult dossiers like Iran Nuclear; and on Iraq where an important meeting in December held here encouraged the Sunni communities to take part in last months elections \u2013 and on the MEPP, where the Government of Turkey facilitated last years historic meeting between Israel and Pakistan.

        "Despite these mutual dependencies on Turkey, it is no secret that some people within the European Union worry about the potential impact of Turkish membership, especially on their jobs and livelihoods.

Another, BP, is the largest single shareholder in the Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan pipeline.

The British Council \u2013 which runs cultural and educational exchanges \u2013 has a bigger operation in Turkey than in any of the current EU-25 member states. On a very personal note, the Turkish footballer Tugay Kerimoglu has been terrific as a team member of Blackburn Rovers on the field; but he is also a great ambassador for Turkey and imperceptibly I believe the presence in our team of a player of the Muslim faith has encouraged more of my Muslim constituents to attend matches. And last year around 1.8 million British tourists came to Turkey \u2013 a year on year increase of nearly 30 per cent, in spite of July\u2019s cowardly terrorist attacks in Kusadasi and other resorts.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
        "The second point I wanted to make this evening is this. On October 3rd we ended a long journey dating back to Turkey\u2019s original association agreement with the EEC in 1963.
