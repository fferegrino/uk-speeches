        "Early years settings can stay open during the lockdown, but the Government\u2019s change to their funding from this month has pushed 20,000 providers to the brink of collapse.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The new lockdown is likely to wipe out demand for childcare, hitting providers\u2019 incomes even further and pushing many nurseries and child-minding businesses over the edge.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Government urgently needs to rethink this funding change and give the sector the targeted support it needs. Early years staff and families of young children also need reassurances about safety at a very worrying time.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
