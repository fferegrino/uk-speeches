        "We\u2019ve got a once in a lifetime opportunity to create a shift in attitudes for generations to come, and get more people choosing to cycle or walk as part of their daily routine.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The measures we\u2019ve set out today in this revolutionary plan will do just that. No matter your age, how far you\u2019re travelling, or your current confidence on a bike \u2013 there are plans to help and support you.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "By helping to fix your bike \u2013 or get an electrically powered one; by increasing storage space at stations, on trains and buses; and by introducing more ways to keep pedestrians and cyclists safe, we\u2019re making it easier than ever to make active travel part of your daily life, and leading England to become a great cycling nation.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
