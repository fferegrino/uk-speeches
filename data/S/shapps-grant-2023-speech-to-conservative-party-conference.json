        "So, we\u2019re building the new Dreadnought-class submarines that will carry Britain\u2019s nuclear deterrent into the middle of the century.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "Second, at the end of what I think has been a concerning week, there\u2019s been a request from NATO\u2019s Supreme Allied Commander Europe, and so I have authorised the full deployment of a battalion-sized UK Strategic Reserve Force to NATO\u2019s Kosovo peacekeeping mission.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "Starmer actually backed plans for Britain to adopt a \u2018non-nuclear, non-aligned defence policy\u2019.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "In plain English, that meant scrapping Trident, abandoning NATO and leaving us naked in the face of nuclear threats from the Kremlin.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And that isn\u2019t just the Starmer of the past.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "And if \u2013 perish the thought \u2013 Labour get back into power, the old habits will resurface. Defence \u2013 always dismissed and disparaged by the Left \u2013 will be the first casualty.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Our service people and defence industries, and our veterans all deserve much better.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Conference, we must not let that happen.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
