        "My Lords, over the recent Christmas Recess, I spent some time\u2014not all the time\u2014reading some maiden speeches made by those coming into this place. It strikes me that there is an accepted formula in being uncontroversial while paying tribute to the friendliness, efficiency and tolerance exhibited by all the staff in this place, from the Lord Speaker and his office to Black Rod and her office, the clerks, the Vote Office and the doorkeepers, who are of course the people who run this place. I had thought that the kindness exhibited to me was exceptional but, clearly, it is a common experience; none the less, I wish to add my gratitude to them.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
        "Having spent almost two decades in the other place, I am acutely aware that nothing must be more irksome to your Lordships than somebody coming here from there and thinking that they know everything. This place is different and all the better for it. I am therefore hugely indebted to my noble friend Lord Lindsay for helping me to avoid the many potholes and pitfalls. I am also indebted to my noble friends Lord Strathclyde and Lord Marland, of Odstock, who were kind enough to be my supporters and guided me what looked to be so effortlessly into place\u2014no mean achievement as I am not very good at these things. I think I am the only living former Guards officer who went the wrong way in the Changing of the Guard on the forecourt of Buckingham Palace some 40 years ago, to the consternation and delight of hundreds of Japanese tourists.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
        "It was never really my intention to make my maiden speech so soon, having come into this House only recently. I am still reminded of my maiden speech in the other place in July 2001, which, while perfectly workable, is never likely to be studied or quoted from. I remember on that occasion having to follow on, in a not ideal fashion, from the then new Member of Parliament for Henley, one Boris Johnson. While no such threat confronts me this afternoon, following on from not one but two former high commissioners to Australia, a PUS at the Foreign Office and the Government\u2019s main trade negotiator presents challenges to me in themselves.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
        "Having thought about this, I feel that I can no longer continue with my role as a Trappist monk, since there are so many issues before us that I wish to share my views on and hopefully contribute something useful to. Having served as a Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office, I maintain a deep appreciation and understanding for Northern Ireland and the problems that it has confronted, and which confront it at the moment, not least with the protocol. I very much welcome the recent noise coming from Dublin, given the utterances from Leo Varadkar the new Taoiseach\u2014obviously, he was Taoiseach before and is Taoiseach once more\u2014which will hopefully go some way towards resolving what has become a stalemate.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
        "Also, having spent almost four years as a Minister of State in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, with responsibility for the Commonwealth as an institution but also with responsibility for Asia as part of my portfolio, I wanted to take part in this debate, since this trade deal is of great interest to me. In that role, I had the opportunity of visiting both Australia and New Zealand, and I am very grateful to my noble friend Lord Goodlad for his kind remarks about that.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
        "As we have heard, the devil of these trade agreements is in the detail, and I have no doubt that there will be plenty of conflicting views about this one. It is of course right that we should debate it thoroughly and scrutinise it in detail, but for my part I very much welcome this trade deal. I am not quite 74, which is what my introductory biography in this place said\u2014that was amazing, and there was a certain amount of squinting at me on my first day. However, I am old enough to remember the sense of abandonment that our cousins in Australia and New Zealand felt when the United Kingdom joined the EEC in 1973. Their consensus was that this represented imperial preference in reverse and threatened particularly their exports of beef and lamb. Therefore, it is somewhat ironic that one of the criticisms levelled at this deal is that it will disadvantage our own agriculture sector, particularly in beef and lamb, although this ignores the fact that Australia and New Zealand\u2019s main export markets are now heavily weighted towards Asia. The sense of betrayal at the time was understandable, so I am pleased that half a century later, we can put this to rest and look forwards, not back. Australia and New Zealand are, and have always been, more than just allies and friends. We have so much in common, and no one should underestimate the importance of the Five Eyes agreement and the AUKUS partnership, not least at a time of rising belligerence and influence in the region from China.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
        "I also applaud this Bill because it is the first post-Brexit trade deal to have been negotiated from scratch and, moreover, it is with two fellow members of the Commonwealth. I should at this point draw your Lordships\u2019 attention to the register of interests and my role as deputy chairman of the Commonwealth Enterprise and Investment Council, a not-for-profit organisation revitalised and chaired so dynamically by my noble friend Lord Marland, which promotes intra-Commonwealth trade.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
        "For too long, we have behaved as if the Commonwealth is an embarrassment and not an asset. During my time in government, it sometimes felt as if I was pushing water uphill whenever there was anything to do relating to the Commonwealth. Here I pay tribute to my noble friend Lord Howell of Guildford and the now retired Lord Luce, who at times appeared to be the only two parliamentarians keeping the Commonwealth flame alive. I intend to join them and all those who feel similarly in promoting the Commonwealth, which provides a unique and ready market for British business.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
        "In a recent, not uncontroversial Netflix documentary, which some of us may just have seen\u2014and others may not admit to having seen\u2014one of the contributors labelled the Commonwealth \u201cEmpire 2.0\u201d. Either this was deliberate mischief-making, or it displayed astonishing ignorance; perhaps it was both. What it was not was in any way an accurate description of what today\u2019s Commonwealth is: a voluntary grouping of now 56 countries, some of which, not least the two most recent countries to join, namely, Togo and Gabon, owe nothing in their history to the United Kingdom, having fallen historically within the francophone sphere of influence. Of course, your Lordships will remember that the last Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in June was held in Rwanda, another country with nothing to do with the British Empire or colonialism historically.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
        "This afternoon, we heard a call for the Government to come up with a comprehensive trade strategy, which I would welcome. If the Government do that, I would remind them that the modern Commonwealth is one such opportunity\u2014a Commonwealth that has a population of 2.5 billion people, 60% of whom, critically, are under the age of 30. It represents a third of the world\u2019s population\u2014a billion middle-class consumers. The combined GDP of Commonwealth countries is estimated to reach $19.5 trillion in 2027, almost doubling in 10 years from $10.4 trillion in 2017. It also represents 40% of the global workforce and half of the top 20 global emerging cities. I am sure we will hear from other speakers about the Commonwealth advantage, whereby it is cheaper for one company in a Commonwealth country to trade with another company in another Commonwealth country, with a saving of 21%, based on a common language and legal system.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
        "The opportunities for trade with Australia, New Zealand and the wider Commonwealth are clear. I welcome this trade agreement, which will increase the United Kingdom\u2019s chances of joining the trans-pacific partnership, which is the bigger goal. I hope that the new Minister, my noble friend Lord Johnson of Lainston, will take this opportunity to reaffirm this Government\u2019s commitment to the Commonwealth and everything it represents, and that we can rely on him to be a passionate advocate for it.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework"
