        "Some people say that the world changed on September 11th. They say that we have entered a new era \u2013 that a period of peace and order has been shattered by a wholly new and unexpected threat.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "And they say that out of this, a different world must be born. A world in which everyday behaviour must change. A world which demands a seismic shift in the powers between Government and people. A world that requires the dissolution of old alliances and their replacement with new ones.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "They also say that it is a world that promises a new order. One in which the threat of terror can finally be subdued in favour of a permanent peace. In which alliances that have been forged to root out a specific enemy can be turned to a broader and permanent purpose.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "I do not see September 11th in those terms. I don\u2019t believe that the world before September 11th was as benign as others, then or now, would have us believe. The end of the Cold War did not represent the triumph of reason and goodwill but a victory for a decades-long policy of credible and effective opposition to those who would destroy us. A victory for practicality, not pipe dreams.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "And as the communist threat ended, it was replaced by a myriad of other threats. That\u2019s why, when fashionable opinion regarded a policy of strengthening our defences as being somehow unnecessary I was more determined of the need to defend against different threats. I have spoken often about the threat of rogue states and their connection with terrorism. I have also pointed out that their terror feeds off organised crime and, as a result, links right through to the drug dealers on our street corners and schools.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "And because I don\u2019t believe that the period between the end of the Cold War and September 11th ushered in a new era of consensus, \u2018the end of history\u2019 as some have put it, I am concerned that there are some who say a new global settlement should be the principal goal of the Government.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "Conservatives take the world as it is, not as we would prefer it to be. Those on the Left are always prone to policies that rely on a view of the world as they would wish it to be. So-called ethical foreign policies, or public dreams of pivotal roles take us nowhere if they are built, not on a shrewd understanding of the world as it is, but on a refusal to contemplate a world that eludes attempts to control and order it.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "\u201cInstead of aiming for an all-encompassing consensus built on a vision of a new world order, my instincts are always to build from the bottom up: to derive policy from the instincts and values of the people we represent, guided by our own values.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "To me the grandeur of the response to September 11th lies in the sum of instinctive reactions by a whole host of unrelated people and groups whose behaviour is impelled more by their values than by the deliberate enactment of an ambitious plan. The dying who sustained the lives of their loved ones with a final telephone call. The firefighters who instinctively plunged into the burning buildings to rescue others.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "The Mayor and the President who, in very different ways, found in themselves the ability to lead their people. The ties of history that caused Britain instantly and unswervingly to commit our help to our American friends in the fight against terrorism.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "Perhaps most of all the way sovereign nations came together for a singular, and very specific, purpose that has been conspicuous in its success.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "The steps that these thousands of individuals took were not grounded in some abstract theory, but in values and instincts expressed through actions.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "In Britain today the Government seems to be constantly finding ways to prevent people\u2019s own instincts and values from guiding their behaviour. Whether it is in the public services, in companies or in local and national government, people\u2019s actions are increasingly justified by, or even dictated by, policies with which they must comply. If there\u2019s a single word that has gained currency over the last 30 years, and encapsulates much of what is going wrong, it is \u2018compliance\u2019.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "It is dangerous for at least two reasons. First, the more pervasive is the compliance mentality, the more we degrade the capacity of our employees and our neighbours to exercise personal influence and responsibility. We dumb down the individual.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "Second, it implies that the official view that replaces individual discretion will be wiser and more effective. We need more, not less discretion, as individuals, as teachers, as doctors, as social workers, as neighbours.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "My colleague Oliver Letwin, the Shadow Home Secretary, spoke last week about how we need to support and help families, schools, and communities in building the values that sustain a neighbourly society. An ethos of public service is one such value. Labour claim that the value of public service is incompatible with the private sector. But it is their own remorseless centralisation that is the gravest threat to the notion of public service. Our teachers, our nurses and our police officers will progressively lose their sense of vocation if all they are permitted to do is to follow detailed instructions from Whitehall. Labour are destroying, not building, the neighbourly society by not allowing people the freedom to express their values through their actions.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "At the heart of my politics is a belief that people\u2019s values should be free to drive their behaviour. That applies to political parties as it does to individuals.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "I was recently asked in an interview whether there is a Conservative equivalent of Clause IV in the Labour Party\u2019s constitution: an article of faith that we have to repeal to be seen as a modern party.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "The answer is that it is unimaginable that the Conservative Party should be faced with such a dilemma, because the idea of a Clause IV is inconceivable for us. Labour draw their policies from a blueprint for society. They have a top-down approach to policy which leaves them always susceptible to the glamour of grand schemes and global solutions.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "Blair may have removed Cause IV from Labour\u2019s constitution, but he could not remove it from their hearts. He executed a coup de the\u00e2tre \u2013 milking the applause that were given to a symbolic clash of personalities, the repudiation the old and its replacement with the new.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "Characteristically, though, all of his efforts were focussed on changing the superficial expression, rather than the underlying instincts. Labour remain hostile by instinct to solutions that do not involve heavy state direction. It is no surprise that when Labour\u2019s policies are tested by crisis they fall apart amid chaos and recriminations.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "Stephen Byers, once New Labour\u2019s leading cheerleader for modernisation, now says that there is too much private sector in the Third Way.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "The Health Secretary, Alan Milburn said that he would \u2018come down like a ton of bricks on anyone who has anything to do with the private sector\u2019. He said, just six months ago, \u2018thankfully we have one monopoly provider and that is the National Health Service and as long as there is a Labour government in power that will remain the case\u2019. On Tuesday, in blind panic at the impossibility of delivering health improvements, he said that he wanted to see the end of the NHS as a \u2018centrally run, monopoly provider of services\u2019. When their rhetoric rails against their own instincts it is inevitable, that they should suffer the political equivalent of a nervous breakdown. They have no basis of principle for their policies, so they have nowhere to go, nowhere to turn. So they barricade themselves against reality with 5, 10 and even 20-year plans \u2013 each one more ludicrous than the last.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "John Prescott unveiled a 10-year plan for the railways in 1999. In 2000 we had a 10-year NHS National Plan. Last November the Chancellor announced a 20-year plan for the NHS. On Monday Stephen Byers rushed in another 10-year plan. Two year, two portfolios, four 10-year plans.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "Always a new plan \u2013 they never get shorter, and the Government never talks of being four years into a plan.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "They also have a cynical purpose. They take refuge in the abstract to distract people from what is all too real. They go to enormous lengths to prevent themselves from being judged.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "David Blunkett tries to turns the clock back to zero by blaming their failure on crime on his predecessor, Jack Straw. John Prescott said \u2018judge us on transport after 5 years\u2019. Five years come and Stephen Byers says it will take another 10. If anyone personifies Labour\u2019s failure to hide behind plans rather than take responsibility it is Stephen Byers.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "This whole approach is alien to Conservatives. We have never believed in new world orders or domestic blueprints. We have always been the practical party, because we have never tried to cut ourselves loose from our principles, but instead have expressed them through our policies.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "Conservatives have been successful when we have articulated a clear view of the problems that Britain faces, and have found ways to solve them that rely on empowering people rather than pushing them around. \u2018Trust the people\u2019 has always been a powerful Conservative rallying cry. It has never let us down in the past, and it will not now. We have embarked on the most far-reaching renewal of our policies for a generation. It is our opportunity to refresh our sense of purpose, and to make connections way beyond our usual supporters.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "The first thing this requires is to be clear about our priorities. We can\u2019t concentrate on everything at once, and nor should we. To govern is to choose, and as we prepare for government we will not flinch from making choices.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "We choose to concentrate on the issues that make most difference to people\u2019s lives. So our efforts will be focussed on solving the crisis in our public services \u2013 the health service that makes people afraid to fall sick; schools that deprive millions of children of the opportunities that a first class education offers; a transport system that makes travelling in or between our cities an ordeal.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "And we will focus on the problems \u2013 and they include our public services \u2013 that are hardening the arteries of our economy turning it from one of the most flexible and dynamic in the Western world into one of the most overburdened, conformist and bureaucratic.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "We understand instinctively that the quality of our lives is influenced more by our families, our communities and our environment than by the economic forces that those on the Left think determine our well being. So we will sweep aside Labour\u2019s ludicrous assertion that Britain\u2019s streets are becoming safer than ever. We all know from experience that is not true, and we will look for the means to revive the neighbourliness that stops the conveyor belt of crime from ever taking hold. And we will address the concerns of a new generation for the condition of our environment. It is fertile territory for Conservative thinking. The best traditions of Conservatism are about our duties as stewards of an unending inheritance, rather than revolutionaries seeking to impose a new order.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "During the years ahead, people can count on the Conservatives always to have, at the forefront of our minds, the same concerns that they do.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "As we renew our policies we will not be content to listen only to the usual voices.

        "But the way we develop policy will be characterised by leadership and direction, and based firmly on Conservative values. Our values have stood the test of time. The problems may have changed, but the values that underpin our solutions are as relevant as ever.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "By their nature, Conservative values are not easy to capture in distilled form. Their true expression is through our policies and how we conduct ourselves. But as we renew our policies, and expose the failures of this government, these are the themes that will be consistently expressed.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",
        "The first is that our policies will clearly help people to be more independent of the state. Labour is making Britain a nation of supplicants.

        "And we must go further. It\u2019s not just a matter of increasing people\u2019s independence, our policies must reduce the power of the state over people \u2013 and that is our second principle.

        "It was explicit in the old Clause IV, and is implicit in everything they do in Government.

        "As a country, we have always been stubbornly varied. Our great cities still find their characters in the urban villages that make them up. Our counties are proud of how they differ from their neighbours. They embody a diversity that runs with the grain of Britain\u2019s history and our character. But that diversity cannot be imposed. That is why the Government\u2019s bogus regional agenda seeks to replace what is organic and historical, with something that is alien and unworkable. The only diversity that this Government will permit is one of its own design \u2013 a diversity that is not the outcome of choice, but its reverse \u2013 the attempted imposition of order.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers",

A decade of policies to mollify the threat of ever worsening industrial relations failed absolutely to resolve the insecurity that it bred.
