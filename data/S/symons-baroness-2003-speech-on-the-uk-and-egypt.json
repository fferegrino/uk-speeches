        "I am so pleased that His Excellency Youssef Boutros Ghali and I are able to attend this excellent lunch and to say how much I appreciated the meeting of the Egyptian British Business Council. The Business Council was set up by our two Prime Ministers, and the seniority of the Board members is a reflection of the importance of our business relationship. The EBBC is in a unique position to feed the views of the UK and Egyptian business community into both our governments.

        "The meeting discussed important issues for the Egyptian economy, such as the drop in foreign direct investment in the last year or two. I am responsible for attracting inward investment into Britain, so I know how difficult it can be to get companies to invest. There is only a limited amount of foreign direct investment waiting to find a home, and there are many countries competing for it. Each country has to play to its strengths, but also identify its weaknesses and deal with them. The bottom line is that unless a country\u2019s business environment is as attractive as its competitors\u2019, companies will go elsewhere.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",

        "There is a temptation, when times are difficult, to hang on tight to what is familiar and to delay change. With the Palestinian conflict seeming a long way from a just resolution, and an Iraq crisis hovering over all our heads, the environment feels uncertain. There will be difficult weeks and months ahead, but I very much hope that the outlook will be better by the end of this year. My Prime Minister has shown his determination to press ahead with the steps needed to put the Middle East Peace Process back on the rails. We greatly valued Egypt\u2019s participation in the recent meeting in London on Palestinian reform.

        "On Iraq, war is not inevitable. But time is running out. The threat which Saddam Hussein poses is to us all. That is why the international community must tackle it with deliberate and unified determination. It is why the UN has acted with such determination and sense of purpose, and why we believe it is so important to uphold the authority of the UN \u2013 as we did unanimously on the passage of UNSCR 1441. We all want passionately to avoid military conflict. This is a message my Prime Minister has repeated over and over again. But nobody could be comfortable with the previous or current situation. For years the Iraqi regime has flouted the authority of the UN. For more than 4 years it has been able to develop weapons of mass destruction with no international check whatsoever.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
        "Over the next few weeks, possibly months, we will be working for the highest possible degree of international consensus. We hope that the world community will stick to its unified resolve and bring this issue to a peaceful conclusion. But the key decision rests with Saddam Hussein. Saddam has to cooperate with the UN, and give up his weapons of mass destruction or he will leave the international community with no choice. As long as there is doubt about Saddam\u2019s compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 1441, the threat of force must remain. And as Mr Blix has recently commented, Iraq\u2019s co-operation with the Inspectors falls well short of what is needed.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",

        "Getting the right outcomes on international trade policy will boost trade across the world. The outcome of the WTO meeting in Doha in November 2001 was a substantial step forward. I would also like to applaud the very helpful and pivotal role that Egypt played at the WTO meeting at Doha. There is still a long way to go. But the goal is worth it. Cutting the protectionist barriers to trade world-wide could boost developing country incomes by 150 billion dollars \u2013 that\u2019s three times the value of the international aid currently being given to those countries. And the World Bank have calculated that substantial trade liberalisation could lift an additional 300 million people out of poverty by the year 2015.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
        "I would pick out two priorities for urgent action, and thus two priorities for our international negotiations in the WTO. Firstly, market access. The EU has a good record on industrial products. But on agriculture, Europe is part of the problem. Many of the poorest people in the world work in the labour-intensive agricultural sectors, yet this is the very sector where the average tariffs are highest. It is not just Europe: Japan and the United States are also badly at fault. But Europe simply cannot indulge in high-flown rhetoric about free trade while delaying further reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy in the form of subsidies which distort trade. Our subsidies encourage over-production that has two distorting effects. It cuts us off as a market for developing nations, and it encourages dumping elsewhere. The British Government will continue to press for change.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework",
        "Secondly, services. Efficient services are crucial to all economies.

        "International trade is good for business. Research has shown us those companies engaged in international trade tend to be more productive, and more competitive. They spend more on innovation, they are more capital intensive and their productivity is higher. By choosing to compete in world markets, they take advantage of innovation overseas and adapt it for themselves. That also encourages the transfer of technology \u2013 which is so important in most industries.

        "The UK is proud to be the biggest Western investor in Egypt. The top twelve UK companies have invested $18billion in Egypt, and plan to invest a further $7billion over the next five years. They are doing good business here. Like other markets, if you have a good product at a sensible price, people will buy it. And of course working in Egypt has its own particular problems and advantages \u2013 no two markets are ever the same. But with patience and the right partners, there are real opportunities here. I have had the chance to meet a delegation of people from small and medium sized businesses from the North-West of England yesterday and I want our businessmen to find these opportunities to deepen still further the trade and investment relationship.
