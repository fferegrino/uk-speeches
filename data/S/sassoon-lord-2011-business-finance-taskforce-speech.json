    "summary": "The below speech was made by Lord Sassoon in Sheffield on 15th March 2011, launching the Business Finance Taskforce regional event.",
    "content": [
        "As a Treasury Minister, I felt that I couldn\u2019t possibly turn down the opportunity to speak at this afternoon\u2019s event. More seriously I wanted to be here at the launch of what is a very significant initiative by the major British banks to reconnect with their SME business customers and to help British businesses obtain the finance they need \u2013 finance they need to grow their own businesses and to drive the growth of the economy.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Much of the economic and political debate of the past three years has focused on the role of the banking sector in our society; the relationship that banks have with their customers; and how this feeds through to the rest of the economy.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "In the past few years this relationship has seen its fair share of ups and downs. And regrettably there seem to have been more downs than ups.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Which is why this event \u2013 and similar ones being held up and down the UK \u2013 are so important.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "As today is all about how our largest banks are looking to reconnect with the rest of the economy.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "By this I mean providing the lending that viable businesses need to invest and expand.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Supplying the capital to stimulate enterprise across the country.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And ensuring that we a have financial sector that serves its customers, has their trust, as well as their best interests at heart.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This is vital.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Because if our financial sector doesn\u2019t tick these boxes then we\u2019ll have an economy that struggles to respond to today\u2019s challenges; a country that doesn\u2019t fulfil its potential; and a recovery that fails to gather momentum.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that private finance is the lifeblood of British business\u2026\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u2026and that when our banking system is healthy, then so is our economy.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But the current environment has thrown up particular challenges as banks have retrenched; weathered the financial storm; and looked to rebuild their balance sheets.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I\u2019m all too aware that SMEs in particular have been facing difficulties when on the hunt for affordable lending.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So, as a Government, we\u2019ve been working with the banks to try and get credit flowing again.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Part of this is the recent Project Merlin announcement.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Among other things, this agreement will ensure that, this year, the UK\u2019s largest banks will make available up to \u00a3190 billion to creditworthy businesses\u2026 of which \u00a376 billion has been earmarked specifically for small businesses.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Which is an increase of almost 15 per cent on last year\u2019s lending figures to small business.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "If demand exceeds this, the banks will lend more.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I think we can all agree that this is an excellent starting point\u2026 but there\u2019s still more that needs to be done\u2026\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u2026and ultimately it will be the banks, not the Government, who will have to lead this work.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Which is the focus of today\u2019s event.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I am not only pleased to see the financial sector is taking steps to restore business confidence, and renew the trust that\u2019s been lost. But i also want to commend, not condemn, the BBA and the major banks for the intense effort they have put in over the past nine months in this task.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Through the Business Finance Taskforce \u2013 made up of the British Banker\u2019s Association and the UK\u2019s six largest banks, the industry itself is taking forward a range of initiatives to help better serve its customers. And it has been working closely with Government to shape the Taskforce\u2019s agenda.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Collectively, these reforms \u2013 known as the \u2018Better Business Finance\u2019 package \u2013 will:\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "improve the relationship that banks have with their businesses; ensure better access to finance; and provide better information to increase transparency. And it\u2019s the first of these objectives that I want to concentrate on.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "There has been much debate surrounding whether what we\u2019re currently seeing is either a supply or demand problem.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Certainly, data continues to show that demand for credit from small businesses remains relatively weak, and this is set against a backdrop of lending levels that are on a downward trend.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But from my conversations with business, I know it\u2019s not that simple.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "A large part of demand is about confidence\u2026 and if businesses don\u2019t have confidence in the banks then they\u2019re unlikely to come asking for credit.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That is why I see the task of rebuilding business-bank relationships as so important.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Rightly or wrongly, businesses across Britain believe there\u2019s been a decline in banking standards and a deliberate turning away from \u2018relationship banking\u2019 and personal service.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Rightly or wrongly, many businesses also feel that when they do approach their local banks they\u2019re not made to feel welcome \u2013 that they\u2019re now considered too \u2018high risk\u2019 even when their businesses were never seen as risky before.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Undoubtedly, following the crisis, things have changed.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Banks are understandably more risk averse.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But this perception may also be adding to the apparent suppressed demand for credit \u2013 maybe it\u2019s not so much a lack of demand as discouraged demand that we\u2019re seeing.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I know that this message has been taken on board by the banks.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It\u2019s at the core of the various initiatives included as part of the \u2018Better Business Finance\u2019 project.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It\u2019s the focus of the new lending code and principles, which will set out the minimum standards that smaller enterprises can expect from banks\u2026 and gives details of the help and advice that banks are making available.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And it has helped drive the new transparent appeals process, which will give businesses the chance to voice their concerns if they feel they\u2019ve been unfairly refused credit.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This appeals process will be independently reviewed to ensure that each bank has a fair and equitable process.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I\u2019m pleased to say that the banks will be launching the new Code and Principles, as well as the appeals process, next month.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "From May, they\u2019ll also help coordinate a new national business mentoring network \u2013 using both mentors recruited from their own ranks and, in the first instance, mentors from the not-for-profit sector.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The introduction of new, independent data on business finance supply and demand trends across the UK will also help to restore relationships. I look forward to seeing the first results from these new surveys in July and to tracking the story they tell thereafter.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And our major banks have agreed to publish a regular independent survey of businesses\u2019 experience when looking for access to finance.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This will give a strong indication of how well the banks are doing in meeting the commitments they\u2019ve made.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Taken together, these various initiatives will make the decisions of financial institutions easier for everyone to understand, but also allow customers to hold their banks to account.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That way, we all know where we stand.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And we all know what we can expect.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But what businesses really want is better access to the funds they need for day-to-day financing as well as investment and growth.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Which is why the Government has welcomed the decision of the major UK banks to set up the Business Growth Fund.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This will provide \u00a32.5 billion in equity investment for established small businesses with growth potential over the next 10 years.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And help equity financing again become more of a mainstream financing option.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "If a loan or an overdraft isn\u2019t the most appropriate form of finance for a small business, then banks should say so.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And help business find the type of finance that is right for them \u2013 whether this is an alternative banking product \u2013 like supply chain or invoice financing \u2013 or non-bank lending, including equity.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That\u2019s why today is so important.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Because you can have the best policy in the world, but if no one knows it exists then it\u2019ll never be a success.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Which is why I want to tell you about the other website that is launched today: http://www.betterbusinessfinance.co.uk/. It is a website that may be even more important for the UK economy than the 2012 ticket website.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So the work of the Business Finance Taskforce, and the \u2018Better Business Finance\u2019 initiatives, are important first steps in re-establishing confidence and trust in the financial sector.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It\u2019s this work that is helping the sector as a whole reconnect with the rest of the economy.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And this can\u2019t be overstated.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "As there\u2019s no hiding from the fact that our banks bear some responsibility for what\u2019s happened to the economy.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But equally, they have an important role in getting us out of the mire.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "By providing the finance that\u2019s essential for investment.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The advice that helps businesses grow and succeed.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And the confidence that underpins a flourishing economy.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So I welcome the progress that the banks are making.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I recognise that the Taskforce is taking is taking its job very seriously.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And I\u2019m happy to be part of this process.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Where banks, businesses and the Government are working together to create a strong financial sector\u2026 one that serves the interests of its customers, has the confidence of investors, and helps deliver a strong and sustainable economy.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
