These are decisions that will hit the lowest paid and the most insecure workers the hardest, including care workers, who got us through the toughest parts of the pandemic.

We cannot turn off Britain\u2019s radar before the war is won. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d is not a responsible approach to a deadly virus.

There is no doubt that, as a nation, we need to move on from covid.
