        "The Conservatives are holding children back, with policies that are widening the gap in learning between three and four year olds from the richest and poorest families.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Access to early years education can determine a child\u2019s life chances, yet the Government is locking the poorest children out of the system. Thousands of nurseries and childminders have closed under a decade of Conservative government.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Labour\u2019s Children\u2019s Recovery Plan would help close this gap in learning by giving every child new opportunities to learn, play and develop with extra investment in early education. It\u2019s time the Conservatives match this ambition for every child\u2019s future.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
