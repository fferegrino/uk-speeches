        "Chloe Smith has been an outstanding Member of Parliament for Norwich North since her election in 2009, when at only 27 she became the youngest member of the House of Commons. Since then she has served as a minister in the Treasury, the Cabinet Office, as Minister for Disabled People, and finally as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. She has worked tirelessly on behalf of her constituents in Norwich North, and in Norwich and Norfolk as a whole, while at the same time bringing up a young family with her husband and successfully fighting breast cancer. She will be enormously missed by the many, many people she has helped in her time as a local MP, by her constituency members and her local colleagues. Nationally, her quiet competent presence will also be greatly missed. We will all miss her support and loyal friendship.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
