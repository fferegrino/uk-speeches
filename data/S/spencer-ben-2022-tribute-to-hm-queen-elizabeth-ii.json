        "I rise to speak on behalf of my constituents in Runnymede and Weybridge as we and the nation mourn. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II was an inspirational figure who embodied selfless service.

        "Runnymede and Weybridge has the privilege of being a neighbour to her home in Windsor, and my constituency is adorned with plaques inscribed with her name. We have a statue of Her Majesty at the Runnymede pleasure grounds, unveiled at the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta, which shows just how far we have come in Runnymede since 1215. Her first public visit following lockdown in March 2021 was to Runnymede and Weybridge, where she attended the centenary of the Royal Australian Air Force at the Air Forces Memorial, which she had opened in 1953. That is a fitting example of her commitment to duty and service throughout her reign.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance",
        "I saw at the recent jubilee what the Queen meant to my constituents; there were all the celebrations, garden and street parties, and the lighting of the Chertsey beacon. One of the highlights of the jubilee for me was my school visits, on which I saw countless portraits of the Queen created by local schoolchildren. They were mostly da Vincis; there were some Picassos. Every one of them represented Her late Majesty. As we mourn her passing, the scale of the impact on all of us, the UK and the Commonwealth is clear.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance",
        "If we all aspired to have even a fraction of the compassion, integrity and dedication that the Queen displayed for the world, we would be in a much better place. I hope that part of her legacy will be that each and every one of us uses this time to reflect on her example and what it can teach us. In the long tradition of the monarchy, her attributes will live on in the reign of our new king, Charles III. Runnymede and Weybridge sends its love, thoughts and prayers to His Majesty the King and all the royal family. If our grief is raw, I cannot imagine the pain that the Queen\u2019s family are feeling. Our Queen was loved throughout the world; her legacy lives on. God save the King.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance"
