        "Yes, clearly it does. Those members of society are excluded now, as there is no public transport across the valley. We cannot agree that there would be limited demand for _good, well-planned_ joined up, frequent and affordable public transport. Figures show a minimum of 15,000 journeys each way (mostly cars) within the valley sector. A proportion of these could be shifted to public transport.

        "That is certainly a major component. Public transport throughout the country is poor, not only in Norfolk, despite government statements of the need for \u2018modal shift\u2019. This has led the public to lose trust in public transport outside the very big cities. Norfolk, in particular, has reneged on its promise to introduce \u2018bus rapid transit\u2019 services, which was an agreed action when the NDR was approved. Cost, reliability, frequency, speed, and lack of useful routes has meant that much of the public prefer to rely on their own transport, with resulting increasing congestion and harm to the environment. The attitude of Norfolk CC has been that \u2018this is a car county\u2019.

        "Most certainly. With regard to the NWL area, subsidised bus routes could be introduced from, say, Dereham to the Airport area, Aylsham to Wymondham, Fakenham through Hellesdon and Costessey to the Hospital; a consolidation of bus routes on the A47. These are just a few examples. Bus routes need to be informed by detailed origin and destination analysis, with continual review when in operation. We have noted much support for the improvement of bus services when have raised this at events. It is worth bearing in mind that the result of the most recent general questionnaire on transport in Norfolk (before the NDR was built, in 2005) the MOST popular policy was \u2018improve public transport\u2019.
