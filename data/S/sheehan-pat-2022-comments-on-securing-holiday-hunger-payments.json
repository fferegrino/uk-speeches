        "The Halloween break is fast approaching and without an Executive, thousands of families face uncertainty over whether they will receive payments in place of free school meals.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "People are struggling with the cost-of-living crisis and these payments are a lifeline to many children and their families, and it is cruel and unacceptable that the DUP would cause such uncertainty.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Finance Minister set aside funding to tackle holiday hunger for over 100,000 children and young people over the next three years, but this cannot be signed off without an Executive.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The easiest way of getting that money out the door is forming an Executive today. And I would urge the DUP to end its boycott and work with the rest of us to support hard-pressed workers and families now.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
