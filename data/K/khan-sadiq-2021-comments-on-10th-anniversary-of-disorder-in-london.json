        "It\u2019s crucial we tackle these challenges head on by advocating for increased funding and support to help regenerate the most deprived parts of our city.

        "Young people need constructive things to do, that is why I\u2019ve already invested in positive opportunities for more than 110,000 young Londoners, supporting them into education, training, culture and sports and diverting them away from criminal gangs and violence. I have also developed an Action Plan, in consultation with communities, to improve trust and confidence in the Metropolitan police to address concerns about the disproportionate use of certain police powers, particularly those affecting Black Londoners.
