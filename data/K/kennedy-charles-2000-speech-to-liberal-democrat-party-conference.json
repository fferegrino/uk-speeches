Go back to that high rise flat, in a polluted city, Freedom is also about a decent environment. The greatest freedom we can hand on to future generations, is a planet with a future. The environment is not something that you inherit from your parents. It is something that you preserve for your children. John Stuart Mill talked about the \u201ctyranny of the majority\u201d. Today we should recognise that pollution is the most pernicious tyranny of all. And it affects the poor the most. Yet all too often, politicians shy away from that. Even we, Liberal Democrats, too many of us, certainly myself included, have ducked some tough questions. We haven\u2019t talked about the environment nearly enough in the past few years. We\u2019ve been criticised for that by people like Friends of the Earth. It\u2019s a fair point. I accept it. Too often, environmental concerns have been seen as constraints.

        "Protecting the environment is the most fundamental liberation politics. Broadening choice at ALL levels of society. Creating jobs. Building a better, more sustainable, more cohesive society. The essence of Liberal Democracy. So it\u2019s vital that we start persuading the British people. Persuading them that the environment is one of the biggest issues in politics. And that it has a massive impact on quality of life. Let\u2019s look at the facts. The facts. Climate change. The major problem. Latest figures show that global warming is happening fast. Much faster than we have ever imagined. And if action isn\u2019t taken to cut greenhouse gasses, temperatures will rise even more dramatically. Faster rises than at any time since the end of the last ice age. Britain will face particular problems It\u2019s not just Plymouth that has palm trees. My own constituency does too.

        "Yet the public policy response? What was once a Labour manifesto pledge is now only a goal. A vague aspiration. A familiar story, isn\u2019t it? We\u2019ve seen the evidence of global warming in Mozambique. You know, I couldn\u2019t actually believe it. The politicians were talking about helicopters. How many. And when they should have been sent. How much more powerful it would be, if they spent as much time stopping it becoming an everyday event. That means each individual making changes to their lives. To make a difference to the environment. But it also means changes for government. It\u2019s time now for the British government to make a real difference. To commit to getting 20% of our energy from renewables by 2010. It\u2019s a real issue for all of us. Consider this. Nearly 10% of our best agricultural land is less than 5 metres above sea level.

        "So what does the government do? Number ten is pathetic. Absolutely pathetic. There is no joined-up thinking on the environment. We\u2019ve seen that on GM foods. Ask the others what they think GM is. Labour will say \u201cgrant-maintained\u201d. Tories will say \u201cGeneral Motors\u201d. Liberal Democrats have constantly urged caution. We see science as a servant, never a master. But it took sustained public pressure to make the PM recognise that. The government must now go the whole hog.

        "I am a pro-European. That\u2019s partly because I know that Europe can help the environment. Many environmental problems can only be tackled at an international level. Events in Seattle told us that. So the environment should be part of a genuinely ethical foreign policy. And only by playing a constructive role in Europe can that happen. For the good of the environment, there\u2019s one issue the government must take seriously. Transport. This is John Prescott\u2019s job. Good old John. He tries hard.

And we all know that Susan Kramer has the best tube policy for London. No surprise there that Frank Dobson\u2019s going well and truly down the tube. And let me set you a challenge for the next election. I want our party to turn the phrase \u201con your bike\u201d into a compliment, not an insult. And what about walking? John Prescott doesn\u2019t really understand walking. Or talking for that matter. And as for walking and talking. The mind boggles. But we can manage it.

        "Environmental politics adds up to more family-friendly politics. Getting that message across will change attitudes. That, ultimately, is the challenge. Without a \u2018green culture\u2019, government will legislate in vain. Nobody should think that changing a culture is impossible. Cast your minds back ten years ago. It was unconventional to recycle anything. But it\u2019s now common practice throughout Britain. As a party, we can claim some credit. Our councils in particular. And the pressure groups. Even the government loves it. It recycles everything. Its policies. Our policies. But most of all, they love recycling their funding commitments. So I want us to lead a cultural change. People say that they want a better environment. We need to help people understand that our policies will give them that.

        "Fuel poverty. Why is it that so many of the poorest people, often the oldest, can\u2019t afford to heat their homes. It\u2019s so costly because homes are not properly insulated. They pump heat into the skies, and their homes remain cold. Because they remain cold, they get ill. And even, sometimes, they die. Over 40,000 died last winter alone. An absolute scandal. So come on colleagues. Let\u2019s think imaginatively. Why can\u2019t GPs issue prescriptions for home insulation? It will promote better health. Save heating costs. And lead to a better environment.
