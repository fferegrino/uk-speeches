        "As usual the Prime Minister evaded answering many of the questions he was asked. But the central question on the Hutton inquiry was not posed. That is: If Lord Hutton concludes that his limited remit has prevented him from fully investigating the circumstances leading to Dr David Kelly\u2019s death will the Prime Minister then agree to set up a more wide-ranging independent inquiry, headed by a judge, into the events which led us going to war?
