        "This Windrush Day, I want to pay tribute to the way that the Windrush Generation has helped to make our city what it is today.

        "It is unacceptable that today undocumented Londoners can struggle to access free healthcare due to worries about proving their immigration status, and that many migrant workers are effectively required to pay a double tax through the extortionate immigration health surcharge.
