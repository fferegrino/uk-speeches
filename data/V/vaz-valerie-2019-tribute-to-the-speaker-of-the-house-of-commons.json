        "May I start by thanking the Leader of the House for his statement? I note that there are no business questions this morning, but he did say that you would allow us a bit of latitude, Mr Speaker, so may I ask one question through you? When is Parliament likely to return after the election? Perhaps the Leader of the House could answer that in his own time.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations",

I think that made a huge difference to us.

It is really important for people to see what goes on in Speaker\u2019s House, and I am sure many people will thank you for that.

        "Mr Speaker, you are chancellor of two universities: the University of Bedfordshire and, your alma mater, the University of Essex. I know that you will continue to teach them about how Parliament can be opened up. You have opened up Parliament, which has been part of the golden triangle of accountability involving the Executive and the judiciary. Parliament is not the subservient partner, but, under your speakership, the equal and relevant partner. I say to the other side that I think you did do your job as a very impartial Speaker. I know that some of us on our side actually questioned you calling other sides first. So everybody thinks that you are an impartial Speaker and have favourites one way or the other.
