        "This has been one of the most challenging years. We have had Savile, Lord MacAlpine, the Leveson Report, the spotlight has been on failures. I want to talk about the success of the British media. The BBC covered the Olympics superbly. Channel 4 transformed forever the way the Paralympics are seen. The Mail Online became the most visited English language newspaper website in the world. There was record inwards investment in British film and television from the likes of Disney, Warner Brothers and Discovery. Skyfall became the highest grossing film of all time at the UK Box office. British consumers broke the \u00a31 billion level in digital downloads.
