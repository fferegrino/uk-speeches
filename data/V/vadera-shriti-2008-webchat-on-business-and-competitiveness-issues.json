        "**Shriti replies:** I know that small firms are the life-blood of the economy, not only do you generate more than half of GDP, you are more productive and employ more people than large businesses and very importantly you challenge large businesses. I appreciate that the burden of tax is felt more keenly by smaller firms. That is why we have a small companies rate of tax which is lower than that of large companies and lower than the level we had in 1997. It is true that this has increased in recent years but that is because that very attractive rate became an avenue for self-employed people to incorporate into businesses and unfairly reduce their tax bill. But to ensure that we supported small businesses that choose to in invest and grow we introduced \u201cthe annual investment allowance\u201d which provides full tax relief for their capital investment and we have a payable R&D tax credit of 175 per cent for our innovative small businesses. We are seized of the need to make the tax system simpler for small businesses.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations",

We continue to look at why people do not take up Broadband when they could and find that lack of interest, lack of confidence, and lack of skills are a major reason. Cost is not often the reason people do not connect themselves to Broadband.

The danger is that if the Uk allows other countries to update their internet infrastructures ahead of us then there will be a talent-drain out to those countries.

        "**Shriti replies:** It is exactly because I was worried about other countries getting ahead of us that I commissioned Francesco Caio to do a Review of how the UK should get high speed Broadband and not be left behind. Ten years ago we had a vision for digital Britain but virtually no Broadband connections. We have made that vision a reality today with one of the most extensive Broadband networks in the world. 99.8 per cent of households have access to Broadband and 58 per cent of households are connected. But we now want it to be faster and better and of course we want everyone connected. What Francesco found was that in fact we are not being left behind although we must not be complacent and Government must show leadership and stay vigilant. I have every intention of doing that. He also gave us a specific number of recommendations to ensure high speed Broadband is delivered, which we will be taking forward. BT and Virgin have already made announcements which would provide about half the population with access to high speed Broadband in the next couple of years. And that is just the start. I also think we should be aware that high speed Broadband could be provided not just by fibre but by wireless, mobile or satellite which opens up a whole new set of possibilities. We want to make the vision of everyone connected to high speed Broadband a reality in Britain.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations",

        "**Shriti replies:** I should be absolutely clear that record companies do not have details of file sharers and in fact cannot and will not be providing them to ISPs. What they do is go online to file sharing sites and download copyright material which enables them to track where the material is available from. This information does not include any personal details, just the time and date of the event, the IP address and the copyright material involved. Anyone can get this information. The ISP can match this information with the individual subscriber and, in the deal that was agreed, will write to them. They will not pass any personal details on to record companies. The letters will, I hope, also tell people how to get music on-line legally in a way that customers like. And I totally agree with you that cutting off internet connections would be a hugely disproportionate response and is not contemplated in the deal that was signed.

I know that this is a very difficult climate for all entrepreneurs and we are doing everything we can to help, including help and support and advice, helping mentoring networks, making sure that entrepreneurs prepare for investment, providing funding for Start-Ups and growth through enterprise capital funds, supporting lending by banks. And we also have a debt-line 0800 197 6026. Entrepreneurship for me is the key to Britain being successful and inspiring young entrepreneurs is the best way to ensure a lifetime of innovation and creativity. I am really pleased that there are 200,000 more young people in the last five years interested in starting businesses.

        "**Andrew Jackson:** I want to start a business that uses Ordnance Survey maps \u2013 a business that I hope will generate lots of tax revenues for the Treasury. However, for a startup there\u2019s no way I afford the costs or deal with the infuriating bureaucracy of dealing with this organisation.

        "**Shriti replies:** I am delighted you wanted to start a business and would like to do anything I can to help. I know entities like Ordnance Survey and the Met Office and others have important information that can be used by businesses for the benefit of the whole economy. That is why at the Budget this year I set up \u2013 with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury \u2013 a review to look at how we can make this information available easily to businesses. I am hoping to see the recommendations soon and we will act on them as soon as we can. I appreciate this may not fit with the timetable of your business plan but I will speed this work up as much as I can.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners\n  *[R+D]: research and development\n  *[GVA]: gross value added - the measure of the value of goods and services produced in a sector\n  *[CEOs]: chief executive officers\n  *[OECD]: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[\n  ESA\n ]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EIF]: education inspection framework\n  *[\n  JTAIs\n ]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[JTAIs]: joint targeted area inspections\n  *[\n  ILACS\n ]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[ILACS]: inspections of local authority children's services\n  *[\n  SEND\n ]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and/or disabilities\n  *[EEF]: the Education Endowment Foundation\n  *[DfE]: Department for education\n  *[\n  EIF\n ]: education inspection framework\n  *[HMS]: His Majesty's Ship\n  *[UK]: United Kingdom\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[COP26]: 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\n  *[US]: United States\n  *[UNCLOS]: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\n  *[ASEAN]: Association\u00a0of Southeast Asian\u00a0Nations",
