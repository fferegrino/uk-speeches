        "The return to conflict between the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) and the Ethiopian Government is catastrophic for the people of Ethiopia. This development risks tens of thousands of deaths \u2013 both directly through fighting, and indirectly through a further deepening of the already dire humanitarian situation. 22 months since fighting first began, it is clear that there is no military solution.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "The cessation of hostilities agreed in March 2022 created an opportunity to resolve this conflict politically and enable Ethiopia to return to sustained development and economic growth. The resumption of fighting makes the path to peace much more difficult. Tigrayan forces should immediately cease fighting in Amhara region and return to Tigray. Eritrean forces should leave Tigray. We remain confident that progress towards peace can be made if talks begin.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "The conflict in northern Ethiopia has contributed to one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises, leaving 13 million people in Tigray, Amhara and Afar requiring humanitarian assistance. Conflict, and the TPLF\u2019s seizure of fuel from the World Food Programme, makes the work of humanitarian agencies more difficult. The UK urges all parties to the conflict to guarantee unfettered humanitarian access by immediately ceasing hostilities. The UK calls on the Ethiopian Government to urgently restore services to Tigray and the TPLF to enable the seized fuel to be used for aid distribution and critical services.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "Previous phases of the conflict were marked by terrible violations and abuses of human rights, including sexual violence. The UK will strongly support all efforts to ensure accountability for violations and abuses, including by the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission and the International Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia. There have already been reports of airstrikes on Tigray by the Ethiopian Government resulting in civilian casualties, and of ethnically targeted arrests. It is the responsibility of all parties to the conflict to prioritise the protection of civilians, respect human rights and uphold International Humanitarian Law.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "The only way to resolve this conflict is to reinstate the cessation of hostilities and immediately begin political negotiations. We support the African Union\u2019s mediation efforts to this end, and urge a redoubling of these efforts to avert further escalation.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence"
