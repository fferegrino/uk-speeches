        "Vice-President, Frances, Paul, delegates:\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "It\u2019s wonderful to address you as TUC President.  \nTo be at our first in-person Congress for three years.  \nAnd I want to begin by thanking my two predecessors.  \nTwo good friends of mine.  \nGail Cartmail and Ged Nichols.  \nAs Ged said, there had been 152 TUC Congresses.  \nAnd it was just his luck to preside over the first ever virtual one.  \nBut Ged and Gail both did us proud.  \nWe may have been apart \u2013 but they kept us together.  \nI also want to thank Mike \u2013 boss and friend \u2013 and everyone at Prospect for their support throughout the year.  \nI\u2019m incredibly proud to be part of such a unique union.  \nPrivate and public, we represent professionals and specialists on whom we all depend:  \nThe air traffic controllers keeping our skies safe.  \nOur members keeping the BBC on air in the face of threats to the future of public service broadcasting.  \nScientists tackling our climate emergency.  \nEnergy workers supplying our homes, schools and hospitals despite the extreme weather events across the seasons.  \nAnd I want to say a few words about our members in the civil service.  \nCommitted public servants who helped get us through the pandemic and Brexit.  \nThe scientists whose advice we all depended on, now openly derided by ministers.  \nCivil servants who found out in the Daily Mail about the proposals to cut 91,000 of their jobs.  \nShortly followed by Liz Truss\u2019s ill-conceived plans to introduce regional pay.  \nTo the government, to the new Prime Minister, we say this:  \nTogether we are strong. Together we are united. And together we will fight for our members every step of the way.  \nFriends, my year as President has been dominated by Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine and of course by the cost-of-living crisis.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "I\u2019ve heard the Prime Minister is looking for the anti-growth coalition.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "Yes, the Prime Minister whose budget crashed the economy.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "After less than a fortnight in charge.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "So, I say this to the Prime Minister, if you want to find the anti-growth coalition, then take a look in the mirror.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "Because working people will be taking no lessons on growth from you.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "But there have been many highlights too.  \nAnd none better than meeting trade unionists the length and breadth of the country.  \nDuring the COP26 in Glasgow, I joined the GMB picket line during the refuse collectors\u2019 dispute.  \nMen and women who didn\u2019t just care about the jobs they do and the communities they serve.  \nBut just one example of workers helping to care for our environment, yet so often taken for granted.  \nBecause it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s not just governments or businesses that will tackle climate change.  \nA fair transition simply will not happen unless workers and their unions have a real say in decision-making and are properly supported through a process of fair change.  \nAnd earlier this year, I travelled to Plymouth to unveil a plaque commemorating the return of the Tolpuddle Martyrs.  \nThat was on the same day as P&O workers learned that they were sacked on Zoom.  \nA reminder that almost two centuries after Tolpuddle, workers still face many of the same challenges:  \nBad bosses. Insecure work. A government that serves wealth, but attacks labour.  \nIt\u2019s worth remembering that during the pandemic, the government lauded key workers and worked with unions to deliver furlough.  \nTwo years on, and it attacks those same workers for asking for a decent pay rise \u2013 waging a right-wing assault on our movement.  \nWell, I say this to the government: you\u2019ve completely misjudged the public mood. But you don\u2019t need to take my word for it \u2013 just look at the latest opinion polls.  \nThe British people have rather more faith in trade unionists than they do in Tory politicians. And we will fight any attempt to restrict our employment and trade union rights.  \nWhen we marched on 18 June, we said there was more to follow.  \nAnd Congress, today we are clear:  \nWorkers across the country have had enough and are fighting back.  \nRail workers, bus drivers, posties, NHS staff, teachers and many others across the economy are joining together to send a clear message.  \nWe know it\u2019s not wages that are driving up inflation.  \nBut where\u2019s the scrutiny of profits and bonuses?  \nNo more real term cuts \u2013 we demand fair pay now.  \nIt\u2019s about time the real wealth creators got a look in.  \nDespite promising to get wages rising, the government is once again treating us as the enemy within.  \nWhat do politicians expect? We\u2019re an industrial movement doing our job. Fighting for decent pay for working people.  \nBut Congress, we\u2019re not perfect.  \nAt the start of my year as President, I made tackling sexual harassment a priority.  \nWe\u2019ve done lots of good work. But there\u2019s a lot still to do.  \nAs we know, sexual harassment takes many forms \u2013 from physical harassment to verbal abuse and downloading obscene images at work.  \nBut I want to make one thing clear: it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s Parliament or any other workplace, sexual harassment is never acceptable.  \nAnd that includes our movement too.  \nMost women in this hall will have experienced harassment at some point in our working lives.  \nIt\u2019s upsetting, shocking, humiliating.  \nIt takes a toll on your self-confidence and wellbeing.  \nAnd it makes doing a tough job even tougher.  \nAnd delegates, it makes it harder for women to do our union job too.  \nThat\u2019s another reason why it has to stop.  \nIt\u2019s corrosive and ultimately it weakens us all.  \nSo let\u2019s be clear: all decent trade unionists share an interest in preventing harassment of any kind.  \nNo woman, or man, should suffer in silence.  \nAnd when harassment happens, let\u2019s commit to take action to call it out, stop it, once and for all.  \nCongress, the battle for women\u2019s equality has reached a defining moment.  \nWomen still earn less than men.  \nOur pensions lag behind.  \nAnd our rights are under attack.  \nThe US Supreme Court\u2019s decision on Roe v Wade rolls back 50 years of progress.  \nAn assault not just on women in America, but women worldwide.  \nAnd today we are clear:  \nIt\u2019s not for the radical and religious right to decide what women can, and can\u2019t, do.  \nIt\u2019s for women. And women alone.  \nI\u2019m proud that too we\u2019re making a difference globally.  \nMost importantly, by leading the fight against the far right.  \nLet\u2019s hope Lula gives Bolsonaro the thumping defeat he so richly deserves in the final round of the Brazilian elections at the end of the month.  \nCongress, whether it\u2019s fighting the imprisonment of trade unionists in Turkey.  \nOr supporting the struggle for justice in Palestine.  \nLet\u2019s put our values of internationalism and solidarity into action.  \nAs a trustee of TUC Aid, I\u2019ve seen what we can achieve.  \nSupporting Iraqi women. Tackling sexual harassment in Brazil. And helping our Kenyan brothers and sisters win fair trade deals.  \nCongress, in this country and overseas, equality really must be at the heart of everything we do.  \nAs the TUC\u2019s Anti Racism Task Force has shown, we are at our best when we are boldest.  \nSo let\u2019s secure good jobs for all.  \nAddress our epidemic of low-paid, low-skilled, low-productivity work.  \nAnd deliver genuine flexibility for everyone.  \nIt\u2019s great that flexible working is now so prominent on the agenda.  \nBut the debate shouldn\u2019t just be about middle-class professionals working from home.  \nThat excludes the majority of the working population \u2013 including keyworkers.  \nIt should be about delivering flexibility for all.  \nAnd that includes those in occupations traditionally denied the choices others take for granted.  \nAnd Congress, it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s flexible working, or equality, or higher pay, we know the best way to win for working people:  \nStronger unions. Collective bargaining. And organisation.  \nAnd that really puts the onus on all of us to rebuild our movement.  \nMeeting the demands of a world which is changing fast.  \nAutomation, technological change, the climate emergency \u2013 all demand stronger, not weaker, trade unions.  \nAnd so we must focus relentlessly on growing our membership.  \nReaching out to today\u2019s workers, in all our magnificent diversity.  \nAnd nowhere is that more important than where most people work, in the private sector.  \nTimes may change, jobs may change, but workers still need a union to fight their corner.  \nPublic or private, only strong, growing, representative unions can give working people hope.  \nThe confidence to demand better.  \nAnd that to me is the essence of trades unionism.  \nWorkers joining together to win fairness, justice and equality. To secure good work, good jobs.  \nNever did I imagine I would have the privilege of addressing this Congress as President.  \nNor that, within my working life, women would assume their rightful place as leaders of our movement.  \nFrances, I imagine you\u2019re going to hear a fair few tributes over the next two days.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
