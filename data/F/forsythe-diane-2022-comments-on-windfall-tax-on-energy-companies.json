        "Energy generators are experiencing eyewatering bumper profits with some shareholder dividends rising by 15% yet some of those same companies have not had to pay a penny towards the windfall tax put in place in May. That is scandalous.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "The Government needs to put in place a proper windfall tax on the energy giants so it will then ease the tax burden on already hard-pressed households by helping them further with schemes such as Tax Free Childcare.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "Whilst the electricity cap has made a real tangible difference for householders this month, we now need the \u00a3400 energy payment also delivered in Northern Ireland. The previous Prime Minister was clear in her commitment that households in Northern Ireland would receive the \u00a3400 energy bill discount in November.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "The DUP is in Westminster fighting for Northern Ireland to get real help for working families, whether that be in their electric, gas or oil bills or with their childcare costs. Our MPs made a submission to Treasury last March pressing for help for households and proper taxes on the online and energy giants. It is now time for the Government to properly tax these giants.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence"
