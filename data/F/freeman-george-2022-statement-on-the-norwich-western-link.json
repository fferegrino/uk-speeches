        "Covid is an opportunity to Build Back Better. We need to seize it. That means ensuring we reduce traffic and congestion, invest in good cycle, rail, digital & road infrastructure, and make sure big infrastructure like the A47, NDR and Wensum Link are planned and designed sensitive to the needs of local villages and the local landscape.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "These aren\u2019t easy pay-offs. But with good community consultation, transparency and leadership from elected local MPs and Cllrs we should be able to get it right and leave our beloved county better than we found it.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence"
