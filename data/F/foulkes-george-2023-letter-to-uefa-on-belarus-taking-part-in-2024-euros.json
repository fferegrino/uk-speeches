        "Dear Mr \u010ceferin,\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "I very much appreciated your response to the PACE Resolution which I led, towards the end of 2021, titled \u201cFootball governance: business and values\u201d. In that report we set out a strong case for refuting extravagant models such as the proposed European super league or a biennial, bloated world cup, and I was particularly heartened by your comments which reaffirmed UEFA\u2019s commitment \u201cto stand firmly united behind our values and solidarity-based model.\u201d\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "I believe this spirit of solidarity was, rightly, upheld when UEFA banned the Russian Federation from competing in or hosting UEFA competitions; however I am disappointed that this ban was not extended to the Football Federation of Belarus. I see that UEFA acknowledges the role that Belarus has played in facilitating Russia\u2019s illegal invasion, but banning home games does not seem like an entirely adequate response.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "Belarus served as a base for Russia\u2019s initial invasion of northern Ukraine last February. Since then, it has provided military stores and equipment to Russia, allowed mobilized Russian conscripts to train on its territory, and served as a launching point for missile attacks on Ukraine. It is hard to see how these actions do not merit an all-encompassing ban on participation.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "If UEFA is willing to prevent teams from Belarus and Ukraine from being drawn against each other in UEFA competitions, then surely the simplest way to ensure this is by banning Belarus from the upcoming qualifiers. I believe that the international community must stand united on these matters and therefore hope that UEFA will reconsider their position.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
