        "Firstly, I want to continue creating more jobs and increase incomes.  \nIn the last five years we have promoted over 40,000 jobs though foreign direct investment, business start ups and local support.  \nWith the reduction of Corporation Tax to 12.5% from April 2018 I believe we can create tens of thousands ofjobs by 2020.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "Secondly, I want to protect family budgets.  \nDue to the tough decisions taken by DUP Finance Ministers, Northern Ireland continues to have the lowest household taxes anywhere in the UK.  \nWe pay half as much as people in England and around 60% of the average in Scotland. That means people living here get to keep more of their hard earned money than anywhere else in the United Kingdom.  \nIn this next Assembly term I want to continue protectinghousehold budgets, ensuring we don\u2019t raise a penny more in household taxes than is needed.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "Thirdly, I will prioritise spending on the health service.  \nI believe the single most important role for government in Northern Ireland is to provide the best possible health service for all of our people. That\u2019s why our Health Ministers have employed 1200 more nurses and almost 300 more consultants. At the same time, we have tackled waste and saved \u00a3800m.  \nTo build on this work will involve a significant cross party agreement on reform but will also require prioritising funding.
