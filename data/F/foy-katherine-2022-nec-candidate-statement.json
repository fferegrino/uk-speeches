        "I\u2019m standing again for election to the NEC because we need to win the next General Election. The Tories have spent 12 years running down our nations; cutting our services, corrupting our institutions, and dividing our communities. We cannot let them win again. If elected I will work to ensure that all of our campaign teams have all the resources and support they need to win a majority when the time comes.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "I\u2019m standing again because I support party democracy. I want the Labour Party to value its membership as the genuine representation of the party in the country and in our communities. Power within the party should be devolved to ordinary members wherever possible.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "I\u2019m standing again because we still need to do better by our members. Bigotry and factional double standards are quietly tolerated within the party, as widely reported by our Muslim, GRT, BAME, and trans members. We must also avoid complacency by continuing to oppose antisemitism. If elected I will vote to continue adopting and enforcing our zero tolerance policies against hate speech and all forms of prejudice.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "For those who are alone and who are afraid, for those who are powerless; we need to win.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence"
