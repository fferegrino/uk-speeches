        "As the main public transport provider in Norwich, we are acutely aware of the impact that traffic congestion has on our services and the lives of our passengers. With the planned introduction of thousands of new homes, not only in the Greater Norwich area, but specifically to the west of the city, this congestion is only going to get worse.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "A good public transport system is a key part of any thriving city and this is almost impossible to deliver if buses are stuck in traffic queues along with general traffic.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "The Broadland Northway has already delivered viable alternative routes for general traffic to traverse the city, instead of going directly through the centre and we have as a result, seen a reduction in congestion on some corridors.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "There is however, still a significant amount of traffic that uses Dereham Road, the outer ring road and many of the rural roads through Costessey, Drayton and Taverham along with its surrounding areas to travel between the A47 and the A1067 and beyond, to link with the Broadland Northway.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "The proposal to build a western link that would remove the need to either use key arterial routes in the city, or rat run through rural roads, therefore reducing congestion, is one that First East Counties would entirely support.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
