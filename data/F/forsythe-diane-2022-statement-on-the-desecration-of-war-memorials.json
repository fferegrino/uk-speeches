        "This year we unveiled the VC statue in Kilkeel, such was the fear of attack a local organisation installed CCTV. Only this week, the war memorial and service memorial have been attacked twice. This is vile.

        "I am calling for political leadership from all parties in South Down for the arrest and prosecution of those causing criminal damage to the war memorial and I also want to see a more proactive policing operation to ensure the people who feel this is acceptable are brought before the courts.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
