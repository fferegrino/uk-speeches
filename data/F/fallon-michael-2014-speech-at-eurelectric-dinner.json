        "This is a crucial time for EU energy policy. Recent events have brought into focus the importance for all our citizens of energy security. In gatherings such as this there is often very fashionable talk of the so-called trilemma that posits security, affordability, and decarbonisation at opposite points of the triangle. This is false geometry. Without secure, affordable energy we will not be able to move to a more sustainable, lower carbon energy future.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",

        "The Rome G7 Energy communique set out with welcome clarity what we need to do as a Union and as countries to strengthen energy security \u2013 more home-grown energy, reducing energy demand, diversifying supplies and supply routes, and building the missing internal energy infrastructure and integrated markets so energy in all forms can flow smoothly and freely.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "It is vital that we use this momentum to inform decisions that are needed on our objectives for 2030. By acting now we can give investors the certainty they need to commit the enormous sums of money required to modernise and reinforce the EU\u2019s energy infrastructure over the next decade.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",

        "To deliver these benefits we need diverse sources of energy.

        "Renewables play, and will continue to play, an important role both in the European energy system and here in the UK. Through the Levy Control Framework this government has set out support through to 2020; with many countries making retroactive changes and reducing their subsidies, our move is unparalleled.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "In addition to renewables, new nuclear is critical for the future. The UK has already attracted significant levels of investment into the new nuclear build programme. We reached agreement with EDF on the key terms of a proposed investment contract for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. We are now working closely with the European Commission on the Hinkley state aid investigation.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "Given the continuing need for gas, we cannot afford to ignore the potential for domestic less sources. The development of shale gas in Europe could reduce our reliance on imports, could place downward pressure on energy prices and it could support the move away from high carbon fuels.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "So we are very pleased that the Commission responded to calls from the UK and other Member States to adopt a proportionate approach on the regulation of shale. We are conducting a study with Poland on the impact of shale for our countries and the whole EU which I hope will inform the new Commission and the new Parliament on the need to incentivise exploration, rather than bureaucratise.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",

        "We will, of course, continue to need to import energy into Europe for the foreseeable future. Diversification of routes and sources of gas supply to the EU is an important element of the EU\u2019s energy security policy. In that context I was delighted to hear \u2013 earlier this year \u2013 of the Final Investment Decision for the development of the Shah Deniz II gas field in Azerbaijan. This means that the Southern Corridor bringing Caspian Gas via the Trans-Adriatic pipeline to Europe is a significant step closer.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "The Southern Corridor itself will help to improve Europe\u2019s competitiveness, by providing consumers and industry with a new gas import route and supply source, increasing the continent\u2019s energy security, bringing more competition our market.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",

        "What we saw in the European Elections was voters reacting against a European Union that they consider to be heading in the wrong direction. We need an approach that recognises far more sharply that Europe should concentrate on what matters, on growth and jobs.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "And it is that message which must be reflected in the framework for 2030 \u2013 2030 must be a driver for competitiveness and resilience that secures investment in a diverse and low carbon technology base.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "Signing up to yet more targets, irrespective of the impact on consumers and business, would be, in our view, deeply irresponsible.

        "And in cutting emissions Members states too must retain the flexibility to take action at their own pace \u2013 to go no slower and no faster than other European countries if they so wish.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",

        "Thirdly, we can only speculate on and not predict the future. Costs of technologies change, as do national circumstances.
