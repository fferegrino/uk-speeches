        "I believe his becoming the Leader of the Opposition, marks a \u201cTipping Factor\u201d for the Conservative Party\u2019s fortunes since 1992. The media, the business community, and the public, now perceive the Conservative Opposition as led by our most experienced, heavyweight and able politician. Moreover, at a time when the Conservatives have come together, the Labour government is beginning to tear itself apart. The Cabinet cannot agree on Europe, the Euro, foundation hospitals, ID cards or top-up fees \u2013 apart from the growing personal strains.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",

        "We continue to believe that lower taxed economies tend to have higher growth potential and we hope to be able to reduce the tax burden; but we will not promise tax cuts unless and until these can be backed by carefully worked-out and agreed savings in non-value added public expenditure.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "My main task as Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury is to provide the analysis of how we can improve taxpayer value.

        "I remind you of the ECB\u2019s report this summer, that there is \u00a370 billion of wasteful public expenditure by the UK government, which it described as particularly inefficient in comparison to the US and Japan. Years of bumper increases in tax revenues have exacerbated the inevitable, profligate tendencies and poor management in the monopoly, non-commercial public sector.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",

        "Michael Howard has also made it clear that his style of politics will not be to oppose just for Opposition\u2019s sake and to give credit where credit is due.

        "In his book \u201cReforming Britain\u2019s Economic and Financial Policy\u201d, the Chancellor claimed he would pursue a wholly new monetary and fiscal framework. Both claims were, in truth, a fiction. Under the new monetary framework, however, Gordon Brown changed only who should do the interest rate targeting. Under IEA influence, the last Conservative government determined what should be targeted and made controlling inflation a key objective. Post 1997, the monetary framework was not wholly new \u2013 albeit that we accept and support the decision to entrust the Monetary Policy Committee and the Bank of England with the task of setting interest rates.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "The monetary policy framework is, moreoever, now threatened by the government\u2019s in principle commitment to join the Euro, which would mean a one-size fits, all-in interest rate, not based on the UK\u2019s particular economic conditions.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "Part of the Chancellor\u2019s Euro convergance strategy also involves changing the existing inflation target from 2\u00bd% p.a. RPIX to an unspecified HICP target. This will leave the Monetary Policy Committee and the Bank of England with significant problems as the Governor of the Bank of England has pointed out recently \u2013 especially given the omission of housing costs from the HCIP inflation index. This is also, at the very time when Council Tax increases are a growing concern to citizens, where the Chancellor is shifting to an inflation index, which excludes the effects of Council Tax. Also, on 12 occasions since the end of 1999, HICP has been more than 1% below the anticipated 2% HICP target; and during the year to September, the gap between HICP and RPIX was 1.4%, not the 0.5% the average which the Treasury has pointed to.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",

        "On fiscal policy, the Chancellor has based his \u201cprudence\u201d claims on his Golden Rule, requiring the current budget to be balanced over the economic cycle; and the Sustainable Investment Rule, requiring public sector net debt to be stable, at a level below 40% of GDP.

        "The Chancellor is free to determine when the economic cycle started and ends. In the US, this decision is taken by the National Bureau of Economic Research \u2013 an independent body. In the case of the Sustainable Investment Rule, the figures for public sector net debt have been fudged by the government\u2019s extended usage of PFI, PPP and similar off-balance sheet arrangements such as Network Rail. Off-balance sheet government funding is now equal to approximately \u00a3100 billion in total, calculated as the present value of future PFI/PPP liabilities.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "Public sector debt figures also ignore the dramatic growth in unfunded, public sector pension liabilities, recently reported by the government at \u00a3380 billion but using the private sector\u2019s pension discount rate rather than the real yield on index-linked Gilts.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "These two main rules are, moreover, not the final word on economic and fiscal policy. Borrowing for investment, could in principle, be unlimited; the distinction between investment and current expenditure is also capable of being blurred \u2013 including the Chancellor\u2019s own use of language when referring to investment in public sector services. Right now, Treasury spin also appears to be downplaying the Golden Rule in principle.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",

He claimed 2001 saw the sharpest contraction in world growth since 1974. Yet, the IMF advised that the world economy grew by 2.4% in 2001 and by 3% in 2002, compared with growth of around 1% p.a. for the three years in the early 1990s. The Chancellor also claims the UK economy is performing better than other countries, but the IMF says Britain will grow less this year and next year than either the USA or the world as a whole; it has also grown by less than the US, Canadian and Australian economies since 1997.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",

        "Labour committed in 1997 to be wise spenders, not big spenders and to route out waste. Extra spending on public services was promised, only on the principle of it being tied to reform, in order to improve the delivery of services. Overall, since 1997, of the 50% increase in public sector spending, 83% has gone in public sector inflation. On the ONS figures, public sector inflation has risen from 1.6% in 1997 to 6.5% this year and is now over 7%. In the year to Q2, 2003, government consumption expenditure was up 11.8% but outputs were up only 3.9%, implying a 7.6% rate of public sector inflation.
