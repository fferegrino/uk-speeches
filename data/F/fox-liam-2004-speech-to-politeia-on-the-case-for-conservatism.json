        "The last ten years have not been the easiest time to be a Conservative.

        "Throughout the last century the Conservative Party quietly, but resolutely, set itself against the utopian promises of the collectivists or the left who put their trust not in the people, but the state. As a result they were elected to govern by a people who shared their scepticisms and supported the party through bad times and good: in 1924 when they returned them to power, having rejected the false promises of \u2018a new heaven on earth emanating from Whitehall\u2019; in the 1940s when they closed ranks behind Churchill\u2019s promise of \u2018blood, toil, sweat and tears\u2019; and, most recently of all, in the 1980s behind Margaret Thatcher\u2019s resolution to set the economy and the people free.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",
        "Along with Sir Keith Joseph and others she battled to redefine the terms of debate. Her triumph was to persuade voters that they should no longer accept the \u2018lowest common denominator\u2019 that the state was prepared to offer. Her legacy was the proof that there truly was another way. This is a battle to be fought once more, but this time for keeps.\n  *[ISIL]: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n  *[SDGs]: Sustainable Development Goals\n  *[IMF]: International Monetary Fund\n  *[UN]: United Nations\n  *[GDP]: Gross Domestic Product\n  *[UCL]: University College London\n  *[HIV]: human immunodeficiency virus\n  *[AI]: artificial intelligence",

        "Second, as well as leaving people with less and less of their own money, Labour was taking out of their hands the important decisions that affected them and their families. From the education of their children to saving for retirement, the big decisions increasingly became the function of a so-called benevolent state.

The first is to pay for those things that can only be provided collectively: defence, for instance, or the cost of central Government itself.
