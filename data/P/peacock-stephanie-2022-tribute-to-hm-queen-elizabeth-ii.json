        "It is an honour to rise today to pay tribute to Her late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. The whole country, the people of Barnsley, and millions across the Commonwealth and around the world are all mourning the loss of Britain\u2019s longest-reigning monarch. I express my sadness, and I give my condolences and those of the people of Barnsley East to our new King and to our royal family. Anyone who knows me knows I am a strong supporter of our constitutional monarchy\u2014I am a proud royalist\u2014but I have been struck by how both those who share my view and those who hold the opposite one are unified in admiration for our late Queen\u2019s service, commitment and duty. Across the country, there is a profound sense of loss.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Queen Elizabeth II was part of that incredible generation of women\u2014the most prominent of them my grandmother\u2019s generation\u2014who lived through, served in and survived the second world war, at a time when attitudes to women were very different. She perfectly understood the role of a constitutional monarch, public service and duty. She knew it was not her job to solve the problems of the day\u2014that falls to us in this place\u2014but she often spoke to our nation at times of peril, danger and division, delivering a message of comfort and unity. For me, most notably, in the wake of the horrific 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, she said:\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "\u201cGrief is the price we pay for love.\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "We draw on that sentiment today at a time of profound national sadness and mourning.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Members across the House have rightly spoken of how our Queen Elizabeth has been a constant in our lives in an ever-changing world\u2014in difficult times and in happier ones. In 1977, she had been on the throne for a quarter of a century when she visited Barnsley as part of her silver jubilee celebrations. Our town was built on coal, and when she visited in 1954 she was given a commemorative piece to mark the occasion. I know the people of Barnsley celebrated then as they mourn today.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "The late Queen had a unique ability to unite us all, and today we are united in our grief. As the poet laureate, Yorkshireman Simon Armitage, wrote in his collection \u201cQueenhood\u201d to mark the platinum jubilee:\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "\u201cFor generations we will not know such majesty.\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "As our Elizabethan age closes, those words ring true. As we mourn her loss, as we celebrate her life and as we thank her for her service, we say rest in peace, and we say God save the King.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association"
