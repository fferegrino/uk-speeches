        "As this report makes clear, children have needed the government\u2019s support and protection as they faced untold disruption throughout the pandemic, but they have been let down.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Boris Johnson promised to prioritise children\u2019s recovery but threw out his own catch-up chief\u2019s proposals to help children bounce back.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Labour has set out an ambitious children\u2019s recovery plan which prioritises every child\u2019s wellbeing, with new activities promoting social development, as well as their learning.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Conservatives have simply not risen to the scale of the challenge. The Education Secretary must get a grip and match Labour\u2019s ambition by finally delivering a comprehensive recovery plan which will ensure every child can reach their potential.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
