        "Before I begin, I\u2019d like to offer my sincere condolences to the whole of the Amess family \u2013 what happened today is not just a tragedy for them but for all of us who believe that democracy must operate free of fear at a constituency level. As with Jo Cox five years ago, our MPs, whilst protected within Westminster, remain vulnerable when doing the vital public facing aspect of their role.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It\u2019s for these reasons I want to talk this evening about the multiple dangers faced by Democracy \u2013 for me today\u2019s shocking events simply strengthen the case for continual vigilance.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Probably the most overused phrase at a moment like this is: \u201cwhat an honour it is to be speaking at an event which memorialises \u2013 whoever\u201d; but the truth of that sentiment couldn\u2019t be more sincerely felt this evening, nor carry with it more responsibility.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Shirley was an admired friend and major influence for almost fifty years \u2013 there are not half a dozen people in public life who have more accurately reflected the expectations I\u2019ve hoped for myself.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We shared the privilege of having parents who had risked a great deal and gave up chunks of their life to make the world a better, safer place.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "In her phrase they had \u201ca commitment to the idea and the ideal of public life\u201d.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "In her own life she left us with an almost impossible debt to repay \u2013 but this evening I\u2019m going to give it a shot.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I\u2019ve done a fair bit of reading and revision in preparing for this lecture and, as most members of the House of Lords will acknowledge, it\u2019s a wonderful sense of relief not to constantly have to check a word count to stay within the five, four or even three-minute speaking times that have become commonplace.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "How it\u2019s possible to make a persuasive argument within those restrictions is totally beyond me \u2013 I frequently reflect upon the 272 words in the Gettysburg address \u2013 and then remember that Lincoln\u2019s speech was essentially an \u2018assertion\u2019 not an argument \u2013 although history has judged it as both.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This issue of \u2019assertions\u2019 is one I\u2019ll be returning to; but I can\u2019t be the only member of the House of Lords who\u2019s become increasingly frustrated by the fact that in Parliament, as elsewhere, we no longer engage in serious \u2018debate\u2019 \u2013 we simply trade assertions.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u2018Debate\u2019 as I have always understood it, is \u2018persuasion\u2019 based on competing interpretations of evidence; and the ability to form a compelling argument and, where necessary, seek compromise.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Sadly, that\u2019s been substituted by a \u2018dialogue of the deaf, typified by the Government\u2019s refusal to answer serious questions, or offer any well-thought-through arguments in defence of seemingly immutable positions.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Their view appears to be \u2018we are the Government \u2013 take it or leave it!\u2019\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "To say that I find it disheartening would be an understatement.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Over the course of the next thirty minutes, at times using Shirley\u2019s own words, I\u2019ll argue that not only does the world in general find itself in a bad place, but I\u2019ll try to set out some of the reasons we find ourselves careening down a path to self-inflicted disaster or, in the case of the UK, irrelevance.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I was tempted to use a more ambiguous word than \u2018disaster\u2019, but that would only be adding to the pile of misinformation in which we\u2019re already drowning.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "A large portion of my life has been spent as a cinematic storyteller.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But I\u2019d suggest that all thirty of the films I made for film and television tried, with mixed success, to offer something beyond a straightforward narrative \u2013 something for the audience to discuss and perhaps even argue about long after they\u2019d left the cinema.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So was there a particular insight I kept trying to get across \u2013 and if so, what might have been its gestation?\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Early on in my career I could only draw from a couple of dozen uneventful, but easily illustrated years growing up in the North London suburbs.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I was the quintessential beneficiary of the policies of the post-war Labour Government \u2013 in health, in social security and, as one who squeezed over the hurdle of the eleven-plus \u2013 even in education.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That \u201crevolution by consent\u201d Shirley used to refer to.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "By my late twenties I\u2019d been responsible for three or four films set against the background of those early experiences, the success of which had given me some limited credibility as a producer.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So much so that in 1971, together with my partner and friend, Sandy Lieberson, I had the audacity to bid for the rights to a book which had become a huge international best seller.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That book was \u2018Inside the Third Reich\u2019 by Albert Speer.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We were rank outsiders in pursuit of these rights, but the publisher generously agreed that we might at least travel to Heidelberg and make our case in person.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Albert Speer, Hitler\u2019s former Architect and Armaments Minister had walked out of Spandau prison five years earlier, having served twenty years for war crimes \u2013 he patiently listened for several hours as we took him through our reasons for wanting to make the film and, to our amazement, he agreed that if a movie was to be made, it should be produced by and for a younger generation.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That was the start of an adventure which took us and our screenwriter Andrew Birkin on numerous occasions back and forth to Heidelberg.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It was during those conversations with Speer that I came to understand what we now call \u2018the fascist play book\u2019 \u2013 the way democracy can be corrupted and overturned by a few malevolent but persuasive politicians, those who are prepared to exploit divisions in society with simple populist messages.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "He explained the extent to which we were all vulnerable, and the importance of developing the form of \u2018moral vigilance\u2019 required to recognise nascent evil for what it is.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Having joined the National Socialist Party in 1931 with a view to furthering his career as an Architect, what should have been the moment of truth came seven years later.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Driving to his office on November 1938 he passed the smouldering ruins of Berlin\u2019s synagogues, the result of the orchestrated riots of the previous night \u2013 \u2018Kristallnacht\u2019.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "As he puts it in his book, \u201cmost of all I was offended by the smashed panes of shop windows which offended my sense of middle-class order\u201d \u2013 he goes on: \u201cwhat I didn\u2019t see was that more was being smashed than glass, that on that night Hitler (actually Germany) had taken a step that irrevocably sealed the fate of his country.\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "He concludes: \u201cdid I sense that this outbreak of hoodlumism was changing my own moral substance? I do not know.\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "A more politically astute man would have realised that Rubicon had been crossed five years earlier, in the aftermath of the Reichstag Fire and the subsequent Enabling Decree, which effectively disbanded Parliament and handed absolute power to Hitler.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The full title of the Act was \u2018The Decree for the Protection of the People and the State\u2019.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It\u2019s an interesting word \u2018enabling\u2019, it sounds fairly harmless \u2013 as in \u2018enabling\u2019 a child or an elderly person to safely cross a road.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "How often do powers accrue to Parliament through a piece of legislation whose intent is the precise opposite of its title?\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Take for example the present Government\u2019s plans to revise the Data Protection regime, their consultation allows for the impression that they\u2019re simply \u2018freeing us up from bureaucracy\u2019, when by far the most likely outcome is the privatisation, exploitation and sale of our personal data.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It might be a good idea to take a long hard look at what else is coming down the track.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "An \u2018Elections Bill\u2019 that, contrary to the advice of the Committee for Standards in Public Life, is set on undermining our long established independent \u2018Electoral Commission\u2019; a Bill to reform Judicial Review whose principal aim is to reduce the role of the Judiciary; a Police Bill that weakens the right to legal protest; along with a plan to \u2018widen the scope of the Official Secrets Act\u2019 with no commitment to add a public interest defence for journalists \u2013 even an Education Bill that seeks to reduce traditional academic freedoms in the area of Teacher Training! All of this accompanied by continued mutterings about \u2018unelected judges\u2019 in Strasbourg, and \u2018reforming\u2019 the UK\u2019s implementation of the European Human Rights Act, potentially forcing us out of the Council of Europe.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And with every passing month there are more \u2013 each of them setting out to chip away at and undermine much of what defines an active liberal democracy: those institutions that might act as checks and balances on a populist government that\u2019s trampling on long held rights and conventions, with the sole purpose of tightening its own grip on power.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Which is why a free and fearless media is essential to democracy.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So when the Prime Minister actively \u2013 and repeatedly \u2013 intervenes to manipulate an ideological ally into the Chairmanship of Ofcom, every alarm bell should start to ring signalling the absolute nonsense that\u2019s being made of the regulator\u2019s independence.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It\u2019s worth pausing here to remind ourselves that Ofcom\u2019s primary duty, as amended in the Commons, and set out in her speech of Monday 4th July 2003 by my greatly missed friend the then Secretary of State, Tessa Jowell, is as follows:\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u201cOfcom shall have a primary duty to citizens and consumers whose interests shall be equal.

        "Ofcom will publish a reasoned statement as soon as possible after a decision setting out how the duties came into conflict, how Ofcom resolved that conflict, and the reasons behind its decision.\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Importantly, she concluded:\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u201cThe communications industry is not like any other industry: it is central to the health of our society and the health of our democracy.\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That is why being Chair of Ofcom is unlike almost any other position of trust, and cannot be safely placed in the hands of anyone with a discordantly ideological turn of mind.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It will be similarly fascinating to see how the newly installed Secretary of State chooses to interpret her brief to \u2018protect a public service ethic that is distinctively British\u2019!\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "No government in the world has inherited a more comprehensively tested ecosystem of public service broadcasting. That\u2019s why our formats, ideas, talent, humour and values so effortlessly, and successfully travel around the world. By chipping away at an area of public service the government so clearly loathes, they are in fact undermining precisely that \u2018distinctiveness\u2019 they claim to treasure!\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "When you add the commercially illiterate and ideologically vindictive proposal to \u2018purify by privatisation\u2019 Channel Four, you begin to see how easily our carefully constructed public broadcast system can be smashed to pieces.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Mention of the DCMS brings me back to that \u2018Digital Democracy\u2019 report I mentioned at the outset, and in particular the Government\u2019s draft Online Safety Bill.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "In my view, the Bill in its present form does not go anything like far enough in addressing the issue of personal responsibility, or redress for the profound societal harm caused by tech-enabled misinformation.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "What the principal shareholders of the social media companies know is that the type of adjustments that could be made to their algorithms are likely to adversely impact their \u2018reach\u2019, and therefore their revenues.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "So, despite the fact that they know exactly what they could do to tweak their algorithms, and make them safer, they concoct the same stream of misinformation they facilitate on a daily basis, to protect what is already a dysfunctional business model.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "There you can search for and easily find the evidence given before the Congress in 1994 by the US tobacco barons \u2013 swearing on oath that nicotine was not harmful, and there was no relationship between nicotine and poisoning.

        "We have to get a whole lot smarter in looking at the history of these failures \u2013 to learn from our mistakes and challenge our seeming complacency.
