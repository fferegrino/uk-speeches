        "I can\u2019t imagine the pain and suffering of the families of victims like Kay Richardson, and I want them to know their voices have been heard. Victims and witnesses of the most distressing crimes \u2013 including domestic abuse and sexual violence \u2013 must be protected while allegations are investigated. It is my priority to deliver justice for victims and Kay\u2019s Law will put victims at the heart of the bail system, empower police to ensure that suspects are closely monitored, and protect the public.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association"
