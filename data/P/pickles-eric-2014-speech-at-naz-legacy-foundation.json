        "Of course, we have great role models in the Naz Legacy Foundation, enablers of education, mentoring, and training.

        "It is well deserved, and it is my pleasure to present it.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
