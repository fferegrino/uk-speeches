        "We are seeing a wave of job losses across the high street which is not just a tragedy for the individuals and families concerned but underlines the real challenges facing retail, hospitality and leisure in our towns and cities.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "With many businesses struggling, Boris Johnson\u2019s jobs squeeze threatening those still on furlough in fully and partially shut down sectors, and the lack of support for areas facing local lockdowns, it\u2019s vital that Ministers step up. That\u2019s why Labour has called for a flexible furlough and a Hospitality and High Street Fightback Fund to support businesses and workers in areas and sectors in distress.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
