        "Labour congratulates the 230,000 students who have achieved their Level 3 BTEC qualification today.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "They should be proud of their achievements through the most challenging of circumstances and against the backdrop of a Conservative Government looking to devalue their qualifications.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Despite the high value placed on BTECs by employers and universities, the Government plans to scrap most of these qualifications putting young people\u2019s life chances at risk.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "The Government\u2019s alternative T-Level qualifications are currently unproven and a hasty charge to abolish Level 3 BTECs would be hugely irresponsible.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association"
