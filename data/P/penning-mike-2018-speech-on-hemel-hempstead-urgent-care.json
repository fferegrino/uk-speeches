    "content": [
        "First, may I say what a privilege it is to have secured this Adjournment debate this evening, and how proud I am of my constituents who for so many years have been fighting the changes and particularly the cuts to healthcare in the Dacorum area where my constituency sits? In particular, I thank Edie and Ron Glatter and the Dacorum Hospital Action Group and its fantastic chair Betty Harris, who is very poorly; they have been fighting this campaign for many years. I also pay tribute to the fantastic work our local BBC radio station, BBC Three Counties, has done over the years, in particular that of the excellent journalist and reporter Justin Dealey; without his work, this debate would probably not have taken place.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "For the national health service to carry on being the world-class service it is today, the public, our constituents, need to have faith not only in the fantastic doctors, nurses and porters and those who run the frontline services, but in the management of our hospitals and health provision. I am sorry to say, however, that the trust and feeling of commitment we need from our health service management in our part of the world are not just broken, but have completely failed.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "I will not go into the history because tonight I want to talk about the urgent care centre, but the history of what has been happening to out-of-hours and urgent care, including A&E, in my constituency has been going on for many years. The previous Labour Administration decided to close the A&E and all acute services at the Hemel hospital after they had already been closed at the St Albans hospital, with all services moved into a Victorian hospital next to a football ground in Watford. We will not dwell on that tonight, however, but will come back to it on another evening.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "As part of the sop to my community, we were given an urgent care centre\u201424/7, seven days a week, throughout the day and night\u2014and next to it a walk-in GP centre. I was therefore surprised when Ms Fisher, chief executive of the West Hertfordshire Hospitals Trust, phoned me just before Christmas to say that, sadly, the urgent care centre would have to temporarily close on safety grounds at night. I was shocked by that, not least because the A&E in Watford struggles greatly, so the more people we can encourage to use other NHS facilities instead, the better. I said, \u201cThis is happening over Christmas which is one of the busy times,\u201d and was told, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mr Penning, it\u2019s only a temporary thing and we\u2019ll have it open again just after Christmas.\u201d They then put out a press release headed \u201cTemporary overnight closure of Hemel Hempstead Urgent Care Centre\u201d. Interestingly, that press release is still on their website today. I actually printed it off before I came into the Chamber this evening. As I go through my comments, Members will realise just how false that statement was.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "One of my constituents then contacted Three Counties Radio, and Justin Dealey, its excellent reporter\u2014 acquired an interview with the said Ms Fisher, the chief executive of West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust. It was quite a long interview, in which Ms Fisher indicated:\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "\u201cThis is a short-term measure which is us acting in the interest of patient safety because, for the next few weeks over the festive period, we are unable to secure GP cover.\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "I think most people would understand that, but not if they knew that the GPs were working in the room next door. But that is a separate issue. Justin went on to suggest that surely Ms Fisher understood that local constituents would have real concerns, and asked her whether she would be concerned if she lived in the area. She said:\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "\u201cI completely understand their concerns, but what I want to reassure the residents of Hemel is that if there were to be any permanent change it would be our absolute intention to include people fully\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "in that decision. She went on to say that\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "\u201clegally we would be obliged to consult for a permanent change of that nature.\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "That press release was issued not before Christmas this year but in December 2016. We have had no night provision at all in Hemel since then. Everybody has to go for urgent treatment to Watford A&E. Alternatively, they have to dial 111, which is an excellent service, but after they have been triaged they apparently get sent to Watford A&E. Watford has just come out of special measures, and I praise the work that has been done at the hospital but there is still a lot more to be done.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "**Jim Shannon (Strangford) (DUP)** I thank the right hon. Gentleman for giving way. I sought his permission to intervene on him beforehand. He is outlining very well the issue with the Hemel Hempstead urgent care centre. Does he agree that, although there is immense staffing pressure, closing or scaling back on urgent care units and minor injury units only adds to the pressure on A&Es? There must be more investment in these mid-level centres if we are to prevent the A&Es from crumbling under the weight of the work they have to do.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "**Sir Mike Penning** I clearly agree with my hon. Friend. It was kind of him to come and tell me that he wanted to intervene on me on behalf of other parts of the country that are facing similar pressures.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "This was not about money. Normally, when our constituents come to talk to us, especially about the health service, it is about money. They tell us that they are really concerned that there is not enough money to provide the services, but on this occasion we were told that this was nothing to do with money. It was to do with the contractual problem with the GPs. We kept on asking what was going to happen, and then\u2014completely out of the blue and still without consultation\u2014we were told that the Government had said that there should be no more urgent care centres and that they should become urgent treatment centres instead. I was repeatedly told that it was the Government saying that this should be done. I asked whether the Government had said that the centre should not be open 24/7. I was told no, but that we had to move to being an urgent treatment centre. In the past couple of weeks, the unit has changed from being an urgent care centre to being an urgent treatment \u200bcentre. Interestingly enough, that means that paramedics and nurse practitioners are running the facility, and in many cases\u2014without being rude to our GPs\u2014they have more skills than a basic GP. I have to declare an interest, in that I was a military paramedic, so I am slightly biased about these things.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "But was there a consultation before that decision was made, not just to close the UCC but to change to a UTC? No, there was not, even though it is a legal requirement to have one. We are now in a consultation, however. I could not believe it when I first heard this, but I have now heard from several constituents that in the actual meetings that took place\u2014not when people were writing in\u2014when different plans and options were being put to my constituents, a member of the clinical commissioning group staff was at the table trying to convince the public what sort of option they should go for. If we are going to consult the public, surely we should trust them and then have the confidence to listen to them.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "What I find really fascinating about what is happening in my part of the world is that people from nowhere near my constituency\u2014from the other side of Watford\u2014are being consulted. They would never come to my facility in a million years\u2014unless they just happen to be in the area\u2014but they apparently have the same rights in this consultation as my constituents, who are again losing facilities hand over fist. Those other views are being taken into consideration because they happen to be part of the trust area. My constituents just scratch their heads and say, \u201cThis is illogical.\u201d This facility, even though it is part of the NHS and anybody could come to it, is obviously being used by the largest town in Hertfordshire and the other towns and villages within Dacorum. However, I have no problem with the people of St Albans being consulted over this, because they are clearly part of the process.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Trust has been severely damaged. A highly paid chief executive of an NHS trust went on the radio\u2014telling an MP is one thing, but going public is another\u2014and tells listeners, \u201cThis is temporary. Please do not worry; it will all be okay. By the way, if I did actually change the service, that would be illegal because I have not consulted.\u201d Frankly, when they then did not consult\u2014the UCC is quite clearly never going to open again\u2014that breaks the trust.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "I have raised the accountability issue in the House before. It is absolutely right that my good friend the Minister on the Front Bench does not make decisions about what A&Es and UCCs are open and how many beds there should be. Those are quite clearly clinical decisions that should be based on knowledge and demand in the area\u2014that is not what happened when our A&E was closed\u2014but we seem to have moved from one extreme to another. I am told that if we want to challenge the consultation, the only way is to put the decision to judicial review based on the consultation. We tried that when the A&E was closed and we got a judicial review. The judge was generous and said, \u201cYou have a moral case, but you probably don\u2019t have a clinical case. You don\u2019t have a case in law, because the consultation was done.\u201d However, if the consultation was a complete sham or did not take place at all, where do we go?\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "I have asked Ministers, I have tabled questions and I have been to see the Secretary of State. At the end of the day, who are these people accountable to? I know that \u200bwe can go to the health committees at the local council, but they do not have the powers to say that an individual or a trust has brought the NHS into disrepute, and yet that is what has happened here. Nobody was twisting the chief executive\u2019s arm to go on the radio and say what she said. We all listened to it\u2014I got a transcript the following morning\u2014and I sat with Justin and said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s it, Justin. We\u2019re okay.\u201d I was not at all happy about the facility being closed over the 2016 Christmas period, but at least we knew that GPs were going to be recruited and that we were going to get there.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "However, the exact opposite has happened. We are not getting the GPs back, and now the facility being open 24 hours a day is only one of the options. I know that the Minister\u2019s notes will say how many people used to go to it at night and so on, but half the problem was that it was never properly promoted. There are access issues at the A&E because so many people are turning up and being triaged when a huge percentage of them do not need to be at an A&E but somewhere else within the NHS. I would argue that they should be at a UCC or UTC or that a GP should come out to them, but that is a separate issue because hardly any GPs make home visits in my constituency.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "I know exactly how things work, because I was a Minister for a while and know about the advice that comes down from the trust and the clinical commissioning group, which will say things that are different from what I have said. However, I can honestly say that if there is one issue in my constituency that absolutely unites every political persuasion on my patch, it is the acute health provision in my constituency. We pushed a coffin on a hospital trolley all the way from Hemel Hempstead Hospital to Watford, to indicate that lives would be lost. We had debate after debate with the ambulance service, which said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we can get the ambulances there on time.\u201d It probably could, if it rushed them through on a blue light in the middle of the night\u2014if an ambulance was available. Because of the previous Administration\u2019s botching of the regionalisation of the ambulance service, there are often not that many ambulances available, even though the ambulance depot is on my patch.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "People do not want to clog up A&E; they want to have the confidence that there is somewhere safe that they and their kids can go for treatment. We have no idea what the conclusion of this retrospective consultation will be. We have no faith that even if the conclusions are in agreement with what we want, we will actually get it. Not all my constituents agree with me, but in a treatment centre I would rather have a highly qualified paramedic nurse practitioner than\u2014I have to choose my words carefully here\u2014an ordinary GP, simply because the paramedic nurse practitioner has so much experience in that area. That is where the modernisation of the health service has been so brilliant. But after telling me that the decision was not about money, it is, frankly, disgusting to sit people down at consultation meetings and try to convince them that it would be better if the centre was not open 24 hours a day.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "I hope that the Minister understands how passionate we are about the matter. My constituency is 17 minutes from London and it shares a boundary with yours, Mr Speaker. People in the top part of my constituency all go to Luton and Dunstable\u2014quite rightly so; it is an \u200bexcellent facility\u2014and those in the bottom part of my constituency, or anyone who comes off the M1 and the M25, end up going to Watford for their acute care.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "I want Watford General Hospital to succeed. I think the location of the site is completely ludicrous, and we need a new general hospital for the growing population in our part of the world. I know that you have pressures on housing, Mr Speaker, as we have. But I want the houses, because I want people to have somewhere to live\u2014so many families are struggling at the moment\u2014and if we are to build those houses, we need facilities, such as schools and everything else. When my constituents go to bed at night, they need to know that the urgent care centre is open in case something happens; and that if they cannot cope, we can blue-light them to Watford or to Luton and Dunstable.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "I have tried for weeks and weeks to get this Adjournment debate. My hon. Friend the Minister is lucky, because I had been asking for a 60-minute debate in Westminster Hall. We may yet end up there, but that will depend a lot on what he says from the Dispatch Box.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association"
