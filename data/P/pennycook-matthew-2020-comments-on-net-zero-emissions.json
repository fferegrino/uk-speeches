    "content": [
        "This report lays bare the Government\u2019s failure to put the country on a path to net zero emissions.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "If Ministers were determined to end the UK\u2019s contribution to global heating by mid-century they would have a clear roadmap to achieve that goal, it would be pursued relentlessly from the centre, the institutional architecture would be put in place to coordinate and drive progress across all departments, and emissions reduction would be woven throughout government policy.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Until this Government gives emissions reduction the status it requires and acts accordingly, the UK is destined to remain off track for the net zero target, legislated for just over a year ago.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association"
