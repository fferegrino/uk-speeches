        "It\u2019s vital that the government gets the virus under control, and we support stringent public health measures to drive down infections. However, it\u2019s now critical that adequate economic support goes hand in hand with public health measures, so that we can secure our economy as we safeguard communities.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We\u2019ve already seen the worst recession of any major economy, and unless Ministers put in place a comprehensive, long term plan to give businesses a shot in the arm, we\u2019ll see huge numbers going bust, with the loss of tens of thousands of jobs and livelihoods as a result of government failure.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
