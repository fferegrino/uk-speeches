        "I am delighted to be here in the City today and reaffirm my full support for the UK City of Culture 2013 bid. In a City that boasts everything from the Undertones to Seamus Heaney, The Field Day Theatre Company, Dana, Phil Coulter and many others, a place that is home to talent, creativity, energy and strength the bid deserves every success. While some call it Londonderry and others Derry I\u2019m sure what we want to learn is that this hugely impressive bid is successful next Thursday.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association"
