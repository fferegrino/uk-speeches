        "If the government mishandles the transition away from existing payment schemes, it risks pushing family farms over the edge.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And risk is even greater if the Tories push ahead with a series of race-to-the-bottom trade deals that allow cheap food produced to lower standards to be imported into our shops and high street takeaways.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Where public money is supporting farmers it should rightly promote good environmental practice. But if the government can\u2019t put the new systems in place in time, farmers\u2019 livelihoods won\u2019t survive.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
