        "This report reinforces the urgent need for action on the two biggest food challenges facing Britain: the growing scandal of food poverty and the need to prevent British farmers being undercut in new trade deals.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Far too many children are growing up in difficult circumstances and do not receive free school meals while their families struggle to make ends meet. The Government should be working to ensure every family can afford for their children to get a healthy hot meal every day.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Having heard the message from Labour, the public and farmers that we do not want lower food standards, perhaps hearing it from its own advisor will force the Government to secure Britain\u2019s high food and farming standards in law.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
