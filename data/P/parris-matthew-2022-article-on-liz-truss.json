    "content": [
        "Liz Truss is a planet-sized mass of overconfidence and ambition teetering upon a pinhead of a political brain. It must all come crashing down. Her biggest job has been foreign secretary. Does she join her new best friend, Tom Tugendhat, in condemning the UN security council for its criticism of illegal Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory? Does she really want to \u201creview\u201d (as she\u2019s suggested) Britain\u2019s decision not to join the Americans in moving our embassy to Jerusalem? What did she mean by saying Britain\u2019s civil service culture \u201cstrays into antisemitism\u201d? These explosive hip shots are only indicative.",
        "And now that she moves her attention to domestic politics, does she really believe that \u201cfreedom\u201d and deregulation will help red-wall England? Mansfield isn\u2019t being held back by big government; it\u2019s being held together by it. What are her instincts \u2014 not the corrections she\u2019s been forced to row back to, but her personal instincts \u2014 on help for the poor, on Theresa May\u2019s \u201cgood that government can do\u201d? I think we know."
