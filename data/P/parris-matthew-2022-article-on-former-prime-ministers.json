        "As with Liz Truss, it\u2019s hard to put your finger on what isn\u2019t quite right, but you just know. In a Truss biography (Out of the Blue) published this week, the word \u201cweird\u201d appears 18 times. To a visitor, she says: \u201cI am weird and I don\u2019t have any friends. How can you help me fix that?\u201d  \nTruss is an extreme example and spending four months in the sub-Antarctic an extreme case, but the underlying process is the same. We humans think we\u2019re islands, entire unto ourselves. We think we could stay sane alone on a desert island. In our imagination, other human beings surround us but are separate. We\u2019re unaware of the connections \u2014 myriad, muscular, almost umbilical \u2014 feeding our consciousness, our values, our perspective, our understanding; making and reshaping what and who we are, refreshing, rebooting, pruning, upgrading. In the lingo of IT, we are in a state of automatic and continuous download.",
        "\u2026\u2026.",
        "When you are famous, when you are powerful, when you\u2019re a king of the world, when those around you are dependent on your sympathies, a diary secretary organises your day, you see nobody without prior arrangement, protection officers hover, your media briefings orbit your own interests and anonymity is impossible, much of this unfiltered input begins to dry up. The sound of the commonplace grows fainter; the outlines of people who are of no account begin to blur. The world \u201cout there\u201d feels almost like a hologram. \u201cThe street\u201d becomes for you no",
        "\u2026\u2026\u2026",
        "In the end, I can only prescribe time limits. Within five years, the condition has usually begun to manifest itself. Seven is the absolute limit. Thatcher had 11 and went bonkers, grotesquely unaware of what was going on. Truss managed that in weeks. John Major stayed sane and, in consequence, became deeply depressed."
