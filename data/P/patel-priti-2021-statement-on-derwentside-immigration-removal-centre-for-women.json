        "I am today announcing the opening of Derwentside immigration removal centre for women in County Durham. Detention plays a limited, but crucial role in maintaining effective immigration control and securing our borders. It is right that those with no right to remain in the UK are removed if they do not leave voluntarily.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "This new, smaller immigration removal centre will replace Yarl\u2019s Wood as the only dedicated immigration removal centre for women. In order to maintain operational flexibility, we will continue to maintain some limited detention capacity for women at Colnbrook, Dungavel and Yarl\u2019s Wood. These changes will significantly reduce the overall immigration detention capacity for women.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Derwentside will be operated in line with the statutory framework established by the Immigration Act 1971 and the Detention Centre Rules 2001. The centre will provide safe, secure and fit for purpose accommodation for up to 84 women, with a full range of recreational and healthcare facilities tailored to women.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "We are committed to ensuring the proper protection and treatment of vulnerable people in detention. Safeguarding and promoting the welfare of women is at the forefront of the new facility, and builds on the learning and experience of Yarl\u2019s Wood. The new contract to operate the centre takes into account Stephen Shaw\u2019s reviews of vulnerability in detention, with increased staffing levels and major improvements in the frequency, diversity and accessibility of educational and recreational activities.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association"
