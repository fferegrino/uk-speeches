        "It\u2019s devastating to hear that Hays Travel is faced with having to make almost 900 employees redundant, months after stepping in to save the jobs of those impacted by the collapse of Thomas Cook.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The government\u2019s illogical decision to withdraw furlough support from businesses across the board, regardless of sector or circumstance, is putting so many jobs at risk.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "With forecasts of a 10% unemployment rate and regular mass redundancies, it is clear the government must urgently target support where it is needed and protect people\u2019s livelihoods.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
