Following the terrorist attack at Fishmongers\u2019 Hall in November 2019 we have reviewed our overall approach to counter-terrorism and the package of measures we have announced today represents a major shift in the UK\u2019s approach to the sentencing and management of terrorist offenders.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "The counter-terrorism strategy\u2014CONTEST\u2014was strengthened in 2018 and remains one of the most comprehensive approaches to countering terrorism in the world. But we know the threat we face will to continue to diversify and evolve as it has done in recent years and we must continually assess the effectiveness of our action and remain flexible in adapting our approach.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",

        "A new Counter-Terrorism (Sentencing and Release) Bill, will be introduced in the first 100 days of this Government. The Bill will include measures that will force dangerous terrorist offenders who receive extended determinate sentences to serve the whole time behind bars and will introduce a new statutory minimum sentence of 14 years in prison, which can be applied to those convicted of the most serious terrorist offences.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Funding for CT policing will also grow to \u00a3906 million in 2020-21, a \u00a390 million year-on-year increase. The money will support and maintain the record high numbers of ongoing counter-terrorism policing investigations and ensure a swift and effective response to the threat.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "The Government will also review the support available to victims of terrorism, including families and loved ones, and immediately invest \u00a3500,000 to increase the support provided by the victims of terrorism unit, to ensure more victims get the support and advice they need, faster.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "This package of measures sets out how we will continue to build on the UK\u2019s formidable capabilities, experience and expertise to tackle the growing and changing threat from terrorism in all its forms.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association"
