        "Our brilliant British industries are a crucial cornerstone of our economy, and we should be supporting them to boost our recovery.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Conservatives should be protecting and supporting them through a crisis which has come about from a severe lack of government planning.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It doesn\u2019t make economic sense, nor is it good value for money, to allow a temporary increase in prices to destroy British industries and jobs.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Chancellor should get a grip on this and support our industries \u2013 his complacent and out of touch approach is misguided and is storing up problems down the line that will leave working people paying the price.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
