    "content": [
        "We are heading into very rough water \u2014 government will not be liked but must try to be respected. Brains, experience, honesty, decisiveness, hard work, personal decency and the ability to reassure: these are what we need to see. Huge challenges need huge ability. Complex policymaking needs a superb presiding mind. Serious times need leadership that is utterly serious about itself and its duty. And a nation that has surfeited on froth, nonsense and deceit \u2014 what Sunak in his campaign video yesterday called \u201cfairytales\u201d \u2014 is hungry for honesty, ready to hear the truth. I see two figures who could take this upon their shoulders, but Michael Gove isn\u2019t standing. I know Rishi Sunak and his family only slightly, but my impression is clear and strong. He\u2019s a good man, and he could do the job."
