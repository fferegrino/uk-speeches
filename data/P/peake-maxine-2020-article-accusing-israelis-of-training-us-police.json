        "\u201cI don\u2019t know how we escape that cycle that\u2019s indoctrinated into us all,\u201d continues the 45-year-old. \u201cWell, we get rid of it when we get rid of capitalism as far as I\u2019m concerned. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. The establishment has got to go. We\u2019ve got to change it.\u201d Born in Bolton to a lorry driver father and care worker mother, Peake is strident and expressive; if religion wasn\u2019t anathema to her, she\u2019d be perfect in the pulpit. \u201cSystemic racism is a global issue,\u201d she adds. \u201cThe tactics used by the police in America, kneeling on George Floyd\u2019s neck, that was learnt from seminars with Israeli secret services.\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
