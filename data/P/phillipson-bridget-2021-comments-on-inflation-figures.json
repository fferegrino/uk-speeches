        "The government\u2019s cost of living crisis is sadly not going away.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Tories are out of touch, hitting people with a Universal Credit cut and a jobs tax, just at a time when they\u2019re left with less money in their pockets at the end of the month and are feeling the pinch.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Instead of complacently sitting back and leaving people worse off, Labour would get a grip on the crisis and improve people\u2019s everyday lives. Our plan to buy, make and sell more in Britain is the real route to a higher wage, high productivity economy, backed by a boost to pay and conditions from a \u00a310 minimum wage right now, fair pay agreements and an end to exploitative practices that are lowering standards.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
