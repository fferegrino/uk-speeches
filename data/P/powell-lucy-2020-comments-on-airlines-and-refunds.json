        "Ultimately the law says that refunds should be offered to customers and the airlines and travel industry should be offering them where consumers want them. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve called on companies to comply with consumer rights as part of our conditions for a bail out of the aviation industry.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "However, the Government must do much more to step in with sector specific support so that we don\u2019t see the collapse of the industry with customers money disappearing and the tax payer footing the bill.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
