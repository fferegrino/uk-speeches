        "After a lot of thought I\u2019ve decided to support and nominate Rishi [Sunak] as the next PM. I think he will serve our country\u2019s national interest very well in the months and years ahead, through globally turbulent times. I hope the party unites around whoever wins, in the national interest.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
