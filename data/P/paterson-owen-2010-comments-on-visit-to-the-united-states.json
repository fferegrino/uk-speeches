        "Wherever I went the same message was coming through loud and clear. The US is fully behind our efforts to work with the devolved administration to help Northern Ireland continue to progress towards long term political stability and economic growth.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "It was particularly encouraging to hear that those who try to thwart that progress will gain absolutely no traction in the United States.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
