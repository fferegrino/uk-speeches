        "Today, I am pleased to announce we are publishing the new cross-Government tackling domestic abuse plan.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "The plan sets out the Government\u2019s vision to drive down domestic abuse and domestic homicide cases. And ensure that those who experience domestic abuse get the support they need.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "It was developed using responses to the tackling violence against women and girls call for evidence, which included the brave and harrowing testimonies of domestic abuse victims and survivors. These were invaluable in the development of the plan. It is also closely aligned with the tackling violence against women and girls strategy and shares the same four pillars:\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Prioritising Prevention, which includes measures to identify and address the root causes of domestic abuse, including teaching children about healthy relationships.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Supporting Victims, which sets out a wide-ranging package of support for victims and survivors, including a minimum of \u00a315.7 million per annum ringfenced for community-based services supporting victims and survivors of domestic abuse and sexual violence, with the offer of multi-year funding for providers to aid delivery of high-quality support. In addition, there will be a minimum of \u00a381 million to fund 700 independent domestic violence advocate and independent sexual violence advocate roles, with more funding for an additional 300 roles to be confirmed later this year. The pillar also includes a commitment to review whether the existing statutory leave provisions do enough to support domestic abuse victims and survivors.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Pursuing Perpetrators, which, along with the wider plan, delivers the statutory requirement to produce a strategy for the prosecution and management of domestic abuse perpetrators. The approach it outlines is uncompromising and unrelenting. It involves electronic monitoring, \u00a375 million for perpetrator interventions and research, as well as a commitment to explore tougher ways of managing perpetrators including the creation of a register of domestic abusers.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "A Stronger System, which explains how we will identify more cases, improve co-ordination and collaboration between agencies, and improve our data on and knowledge of domestic abuse. This will be done through up to \u00a37.5 million investment in interventions in healthcare settings, trialling the innovative Ask for ANI codeword scheme in Jobcentre Plus offices and reforms to Domestic Homicide Reviews (DHRs), including steps to increase the number of suicide cases referred for DHRs.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Today, we are also publishing updated versions of the violence against women and girls national statement of expectations and violence against women and girls commissioning toolkit. These documents will support local areas in commissioning effective support services.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "We are also publishing a supporting male victims document today in recognition of the specific challenges which may be faced by men and boys who experience crimes considered violence against women and girls, including domestic abuse.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "The tackling domestic abuse plan has been laid before Parliament as a Command Paper (CP 639). The national statement of expectations, the commissioning toolkit and the supporting male victims document will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses. All documents will be made available on gov.uk.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association"
