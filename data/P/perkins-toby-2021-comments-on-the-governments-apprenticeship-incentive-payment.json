        "Ministers have no plan to reverse the fall in apprentice numbers, they should adopt Labour\u2019s plan for a \u2018Jobs Promise\u2019 for young people including using a structured wage subsidy to create the apprenticeship opportunities young people need to gain productive skills and long-term employment.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association"
