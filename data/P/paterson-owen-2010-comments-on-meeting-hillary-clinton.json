        "This is a very significant week for Northern Ireland. On Wednesday the Chancellor will announce measures to tackle the huge deficit that the coalition government inherited, the biggest in the G20. This will present challenges but it will also open up opportunities. The Coalition is determined to create the conditions for sustained economic growth. That can only be for the long term good of Northern Ireland.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "I will be doing everything in my power to help Northern Ireland attract inward investment and welcome the opportunity to discuss this and other issues with Secretary of State Clinton.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association"
