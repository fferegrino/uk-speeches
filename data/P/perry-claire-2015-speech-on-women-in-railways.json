        "##  Introduction \n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Thank you for that introduction, Adeline (Ginn, Founder of Women in Rail).\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "It\u2019s a real pleasure to be here today, for what is becoming one of the most important events in the rail calendar.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Since Women in Rail was established 3 years ago, it has shone new light on the rail sector.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "It has shown both the great opportunities that rail has for women.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "But it has also shown how the sector must change if it is to draw fully on women\u2019s talent.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "I would like to say a little about each side of this story: the good, and the could-do-better.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "##  Rail renaissance \n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "To start with the good, we can say without contradiction today that Britain is experiencing a rail renaissance.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "In the 20 years since privatisation, customer numbers have more than doubled and rail freight has grown by 75%.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Figures like these would be impressive in any industry.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "But for rail, they are a triumph.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "They are a triumph over the decades in which our railways were written off as the transport mode best left in the nineteenth century.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "And they are a triumph over the view that our railways had been rendered obsolete by the private car and the short haul flight.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Now, with 20 years of growth behind us, we are making unprecedented investment in our networks as we create a world-class, state-of-the-art railway fit for the 21st century.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Wherever you look, there\u2019s growth and activity.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "The new Hitachi train plant has opened in the north-east.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "We\u2019re getting on with electrifying the Transpennine, Great Western and Midland Mainlines.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "We have reopened Birmingham New Street and Manchester Victoria to a rapturous reception\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "And looking ahead, we will open Crossrail and start HS2, before beginning a new round of investment projects that will take us up to 2025 and beyond.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "So these are great years for our railways and for everyone who is working to ensure their success.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "##  Room for improvement \n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "But it would be wrong for me to pretend to that I am wholly satisfied with the status quo.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "Because amid the successes the rail sector is facing two connected challenges.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "##  Skills challenge \n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "The first challenge is our need for more skilled rail workers of all kinds.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "More engineers, surveyors, construction workers, signallers and drivers.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "In all, we estimate that we need 10,000 new engineers to see through the improvements to the existing network.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "And we expect HS2 alone to create 25,000 jobs during construction and 3000 jobs when in operation.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "Yet as things stand today, parts of the rail industry are set to lose half their staff to retirement within the next 15 years.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "That\u2019s unsustainable.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "So we are addressing this skills challenge through the establishment of new training institutions, our commitment to creating 3 million new apprentices, and by the appointment of Terry Morgan \u2013 Crossrail\u2019s Chairman \u2013 to develop a transport skills strategy.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "But these are only part of the solution.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "We can\u2019t hope to have the high performing rail industry that the country needs without first addressing the second great challenge facing the industry today: its dismal performance on gender equality.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "##  Insufficient progress on women in rail \n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "It\u2019s not news to anyone in this room that the rail sector is not hiring or promoting sufficient numbers of women.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "We make up 51% of the population.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "47% of the national workforce.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "But only 15% of the rail workforce.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "The report published by Women in Rail today reveals that out of the 87,000 people working in rail, only 13,492 are women.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "Coincidentally, that is almost exactly the number of women who were working in rail in August 1914, at the dawn of the First World War.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "We can\u2019t make precise comparisons between then and now.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "But it is significant that in absolute terms the number of women working in rail is no greater than it was 100 years ago.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "The result is that when it comes to gender equality the rail industry risks looking like the industry that time has left behind.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "And of those of us who do work in the rail sector, half work in the operational, customer-facing parts of the railway, such as catering, ticketing and station retail.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "I\u2019m glad that women in customer-facing roles are leading the way for the rest of the sector.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "It means that we can look forward to a future in which, for customers, the face of the railway is as likely to be female as it is male.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "But it is wrong that only 19% of women in rail are in managerial roles.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "Or that women make up only 4% of rail engineers.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "Or that only 0.6% of women have progressed to director or executive level.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "For one thing, this lopsided distribution of women in rail does damage to equal pay.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "The starting salary for station assistants, part of the group in which women are disproportionately highly represented, starts at \u00a312,500 a year, rising to around \u00a317,000 after qualification.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "Meanwhile, Network Rail are currently advertising for engineers at salaries starting at just under \u00a340,000 a year and rising far beyond that after promotion.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "So when women are prevented from taking the jobs they could at excel at just because they are women, they\u2019re not just having their choices restricted.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "They are missing out economically.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "Of course, gender imbalance is a problem not just for women in rail.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "But for the rail industry itself, its customers, and everyone who depends on a thriving rail sector.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "Because as Women in Rail\u2019s report reminds us, there\u2019s good evidence that teams and boards that include women have richer skills and broader perspectives.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "As a result, they make better decisions.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "So as long as the rail industry fails to properly draw from the 50% of available talent represented by women, it is likely to be less innovative, less efficient and less productive than it ought to be.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "Other sectors learnt this lesson long ago.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "Among FTSE 100 firms, around a quarter of board members are women and there are no all-male boards left.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two",
        "Half of all solicitors and most GPs are female.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And Mark Carne has spoken of the difference the visible presence of women has made to the oil and gas industry.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "##  Need for action in rail industry \n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "If other industries have made such progress, there is really no excuse for rail.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "There\u2019s so much more to do.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "##  Shift patterns \n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "First, the industry should look at shift patterns.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We know that working in rail can mean working unsociable hours.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Trains run early-till-late and maintenance happens at night or on weekends.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But for many women, particularly after having children, a rigid, inconsiderately-planned shift pattern just doesn\u2019t work.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It\u2019s surely one reason that 22,000 qualified women have not returned to the engineering sector after a career- or maternity-break.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It might take innovation, and a willingness to listen, but a few changes can make a big difference.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "##  Image of the industry \n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Second, we need the industry to change how it presents itself.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "If, as the report says, our daughters are put off careers in rail by stereotypical images of burly men covered in coal dust, we need to use new, more accurate images.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We need to explain the social value of the railway.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "How rail professionals improve the lives of millions of people.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And how a rail engineer today is just as likely to go to work wielding a laptop as wielding a spanner.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "##  Value of engineering qualifications \n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Finally, we need to teach girls the value of transport and engineering qualifications; how those skills are appreciated by employers across the economy.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And how our rail renaissance can provide them with fantastic lifelong careers.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "##  Conclusion \n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That\u2019s why I am so pleased to support Women in Rail \u2013 for showing the rail industry what it misses when it misses out on women, and for inspiring women by showing them what a career in rail can offer.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I am also grateful to every woman who has chosen a career in rail.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "You are building a better railway and a better industry.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Women have proven before that they can keep our railways running and improving.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "100 years ago, we kept the railway running during the greatest challenge it had yet faced.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We might have started the war with 13,000 women working in rail, but by its end there were 70,000.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It shouldn\u2019t take another World War to see change like that again.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Thank you.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
