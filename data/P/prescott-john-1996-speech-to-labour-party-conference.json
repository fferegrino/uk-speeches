        "We\u2019ve been away too long. And millions of people have paid the price for it. We\u2019ve adopted the football song Coming Home. I hear that next week John Major is planning to revive his own 1966 football anthem.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But John, honestly, you can\u2019t make the same impact with World Cup Willie.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But what a great conference we\u2019ve had! Labour\u2019s coming home, And coming together.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Bringing together all the strands in the party \u2013 old and new. Bringing together the politics of ideas and the politics of organisation. I told you it would work.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This week we\u2019ve faced tough choices. Spoken the language of priorities. No more the party of Opposition but a government in waiting.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Counting the days and the weeks till we get rid of this Tory government.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Because this week will go down in history as the week when Labour \u2013 a party reborn, proud of its heritage, confident of its future, clearly proved it is ready for Government.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This week we have seen the team which will form the next Labour government. Led by Tony Blair, our great and sagacious leader. As I always call him.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Compare him with the Galloping Major running scared of Labour, running scared of his own MPs, running scared of an election. And most of all John Major is running scared of Tony Blair.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Because here is a man who leads from the front.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I\u2019ll tell you what. It may be a bumpy ride at times, I know that well enough.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But Tony is a man who knows where he\u2019s going. Who has a clear vision of where the country should be going too. Who strikes a chord with the British people.

        "Just take a look at the gang in charge. John Major. He used to be a banker, you know. He must have worked for the No-one\u2019s Listening Bank. No one listens to him in his own cabinet. No one listens to him in Europe. No one listens to him in Parliament.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But there\u2019s more bad news for John Major. They\u2019re closing his favourite eating-place. The Happy Eater. He\u2019s so depressed. The Happy Eater was the only place he could get anyone to take his orders.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Then there\u2019s Michael Heseltine, the man who advises firms to delay on paying their debts. They say as a politician he owes a lot to Churchill, but Winston\u2019s still waiting for the payment.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "He says the economy is bouncing back. But why are so many cheques doing the same?\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "And finally there\u2019s Major\u2019s side-kick, Doctor Mawhinney, The Colonel Sanders of the Tory Party. Leading the chicken run.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "There\u2019s something you should know about Brian Mawhinney, in case you bump into him. He always get very ratty if you don\u2019t call him Doctor. This began to puzzle me, since he\u2019s the only doctor I\u2019ve ever met who makes everyone feel sick.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I phoned the British Medical Association. They said they\u2019d never heard of him. I began to think he isn\u2019t a chicken at all. He\u2019s a quack.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But then I thought, maybe he\u2019s a spin doctor. But I checked with Peter Mandelson and he said: No he isn\u2019t in the Union \u2026Sorry, Association.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And then I thought, anyone who can turn a &pound;17 million deficit into a &pound;24 million surplus must be a Witch Doctor.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Or maybe he\u2019s Doctor Doolittle. Talking to the animals with their snouts in the trough.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We\u2019ve got to get to the bottom of this. The publics got to be protected.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But I tell you one thing. After the election, he\u2019s going to be \u2026. Doctor Who?\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The best slogan he could think up for their conference next week is Life\u2019s better under the Tories. Sounds to me like one of Steven Norris\u2019s chat up lines.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Can you believe that this lot is in charge? Not for long, eh?\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Then after 17 years of this Tory government, they have the audacity to talk about morality.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Did you hear John Major on the Today programme? \u2013 calling for ethics to come back into the political debate?\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I\u2019m told some Tory MPs think ethics is a county near Middlesex. It\u2019s a bit hard to take: John Major \u2013 ethics man.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Tories have redefined unemployment they have redefined poverty. Now they want to redefine morality.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "For too many Tories, morality means not getting caught.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "John Major\u2019s argument is that cutting public spending and reducing tax is a moral issue.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And what a perverted definition of morality! It\u2019s all about money in the pocket, isn\u2019t it?\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And we\u2019ve heard an awful lot about money in the pockets of Tory MPs lately, haven\u2019t we? I heard two Tory MPs talking last week about cash for questions. One said: What should we do about the Sleaze Bill? The other said: Get someone else to pay it.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Neil Hamilton, that Guardian of Tory morals, told the Deputy Prime Minister he had no financial relationship with a lobbying company. But now we hear he did take payments after all.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But will he resign? No. Tories never know when to say sorry. And if John Major is serious about morality, He should let Nolan look into party funding.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "On Wednesday I called on John Major to join Labour to clean up British politics. Yesterday he said he\u2019ll give evidence. Well I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s just not enough.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "If Neil Hamilton has a shred of honour left in him, he should go and go now.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But John Major can\u2019t afford to lose him, can he? Why? Because this man is his parliamentary majority of one. He is John Major\u2019s immoral majority. And the silent majority have had enough of them.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Because let\u2019s be clear, Morality is measured in more than just money. It&#18;s about right and wrong. it&#18;s about values. it&#18;s about fairness and it\u2019s about social justice.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I\u2019d like to ask John Major this: what morality is there \u2026\u2026.

        "Where\u2019s the morality in people being bussed from one hospital to another begging to be admitted?\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Where\u2019s the morality In record crime? In record unemployment? Record bankruptcies? Record poverty?\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "All the product of deliberate government policy. That\u2019s what I call immoral.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And where\u2019s the morality in 16 year old kids forced to sleep rough on the streets?\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "And after 17 years of Tory government, there are thousands more like Cathy -record numbers of homeless people.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But don\u2019t believe the Tory lie that nothing can be done. It\u2019s time the nation was shocked again.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Because \u2013 what\u2019s really immoral is this\u2026. There\u2019s &pound;5 billion from council house sales locked up by the Tory government. There\u2019s a quarter of a million building workers trapped in unemployment.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But the Tories refuse to bring them together. Labour will bring together the money, the people, the skills to meet the social need of our people.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Labour\u2019s coming home. And when we are in government, Cathy can come home too.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That\u2019s the moral difference between us and the Tories. There is an alternative. New Life for Britain our philosophy our priorities our programme for government.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
