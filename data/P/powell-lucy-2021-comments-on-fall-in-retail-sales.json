        "This should ring alarm bells in the Treasury. Any recovery will be built on sand if previously viable businesses are left to go to the wall through no fault of their own, by a government which has overseen the worst recession of any major economy.

        "Ministers must bring forward urgently a long term comprehensive plan which tackles the cliff edges in support businesses face, and safeguards jobs and livelihoods to secure our economy.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
