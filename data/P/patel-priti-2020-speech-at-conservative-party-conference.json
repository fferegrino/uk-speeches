        "It is not acceptable for mobs to tear down statues and cause criminal damage across our streets.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "And it is not acceptable for thugs to assault our police officers, just for doing their job.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "As our police walk the line of duty, I want every one of them to know, I have their back.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",

        "France, Italy, Spain.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Shopping around for where they claim asylum.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Making that final and extremely dangerous Channel crossing to the United Kingdom, while lining the pockets of despicable international criminal gangs.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Our broken system is enabling this international criminal trade.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "It is disregarding the most vulnerable, elbowing women and children in need to the side.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Trampling over the weak.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "That cannot be right.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",

        "Fair and compassionate towards those who need our help.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Fair by welcoming people through safe and legal routes.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "But firm because we will stop the abuse of the system.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Firm because we will stop those who come here illegally making endless legal claims to remain in our Country at the expense of the British public.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "And firm because we will expedite the removal of those who have no legitimate claim for protection.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "After decades of inaction by successive governments we will address the moral, legal and practical problems with the asylum system.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",

        "But I will be honest with you, this will take time.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "So as we overhaul the system, I will accelerate our operational response to illegal migration.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "We will continue to hunt down the criminal gangs who traffic people into our country.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",

        "We will make more immediate returns of those who come here illegally and break our rules, every single week.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "And we will continue to examine all practical measures to effectively deter illegal migration.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "And no doubt those who are well-rehearsed in how to play and profit from the broken system will lecture us on their grand theories about human rights.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "And yet, they seem to care little about the rights of the most vulnerable who are fleeing persecution, oppression and tyranny.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "What about their right to live their lives securely and free from fear?\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",

        "But lives are already being lost.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "So do not let them peddle a false narrative that Conservatives do not have a proud history of providing a safe haven to those most in need.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "From the expulsion of Ugandan Asians from a repressive regime, to proudly resettling more refugees from outside Europe than any other EU country, to supporting campaigners fleeing political persecution in Hong Kong.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Under Conservative leadership, the United Kingdom has and always will provide sanctuary when the lights are being switched off on people\u2019s liberties.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "As for those defending the broken system \u2013 the traffickers, the do gooders, the leftie lawyers, the Labour Party \u2013 they are defending the indefensible.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",

        "If at times it means being unpopular on Twitter. I will bear it.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "If at times it means Tony Blair\u2019s spin doctor mocking my accent. So be it.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "And if at times it means Labour Members of Parliament attempting to silence me because I do not conform to their idea of what an ethnic minority woman should stand for. I will stomach it.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Because as Conservatives, we do not measure the depth of our compassion in two hundred and eighty characters on Twitter, but in the actions we take and the choices we make.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "**CONCLUSION**\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "This Conservative Government will continue to stand up for the hardworking, law-abiding majority who play by the rules.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "And take action against the minority who do not.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Providing a safe haven to those fleeing persecution, oppression or tyranny.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "But I will not be complicit in an international criminal trade in asylum seekers, elbowing the most vulnerable to the side.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Reform the system, prosecute the criminals, protect the vulnerable.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "That is what a firm, but fair asylum system should look like, and that is what I intend to deliver.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "As Conservatives, we will protect those most in need and put the rights of those who respect the rules above those who take our country for a ride.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Because without firmness, there will be no fairness.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association"
