        "The Joint Committee\u2019s report is welcome and will help improve how the internet is governed.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Social media companies have for too long gotten away with facilitating harmful content online. Current regulation is from the analogue age and lags far, far behind the digital age in which most of us all now live.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Prime Minister\u2019s failure to bring forward the Online Harms Bill by Christmas is yet another broken promise. The Government must now urgently act to strengthen its proposals and bring them to Parliament to prevent more and more people becoming victims online.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
