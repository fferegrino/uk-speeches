        "So far this afternoon, we have heard about journeys punctuated with suffering, with immeasurable loss, and with the scars which still bear their memory.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Journeys to a new life are by no means easier \u2013 but nonetheless I hope they have brought some healing, and the chance of a new start.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "This year is particularly poignant. 75 years have just passed since Kristallnacht \u2013 and as we have just heard, 20 years have passed since the start of the Rwandan genocide.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Time does not stand still to allow us to remember. And as time passes, persecution and hatred remain a threat. Which is why our vigilance can never rest.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "As Josef Stalin said,\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "This is once day dedicated to remembrance reminds us of the people and the stories \u2013 not the statistics.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The walls of the gas chambers cannot talk \u2013 and the grass of the killing fields have no voice.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Human experience is the best memory.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "Journey\u2019s like Ben Helf-gott\u2019s (Helfgott), who went on to captain the British weightlifting team in the Melbourne and Rome Olympics (1956 and 1960).\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Or like Anita Lak-sar Wall-fish\u2019s (Lakser-Wallfisch) \u2013 who believes her talent as a cellist saved her from a certain death. She went from the discomfort of playing for SS officers \u2013 to co-founding the English Chamber Orchestra.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Or a journey like Kitty Hart Moxon\u2019s \u2013 who endured 2 years of concentration camp life and survived the death marches. She trained to become a nurse in Britain. Despite all she had been through \u2013 Kitty retained her humanity to care for others, and tend to the sick.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Their new lives couldn\u2019t erase the past, but decades after the Third Reich, they have been victorious over the Nazis, and they are incredible achievements in the face of adversity.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "**\u2018Seeing is believing\u2019**\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And visiting Auschwitz and Birkenau with the Education Trust is one of the most powerful ways of doing so.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Trust also brings survivors into schools, to share their testimony \u2013 and now it is falling to their children pick up the baton and ensure their legacy never fades.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Incredibly, David Herman, survived 5 separate concentration camps \u2013 an experience that his daughter Julia Burton now retells in schools. Making sure her father\u2019s story, and the words of a Grandmother she never met, is never forgotten.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Alongside the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust and the Holocaust Education Trust \u2013 there are many other ways we combat anti-semitic, anti-muslim, and other hate crimes.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "The road back to Auschwitz is taken by steps. Small acts of intolerance can be very powerful. That is why we must always be vigilant.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We are lucky enough to live in a largely tolerant society. But only a thin veneer separates us from committing such betrayals. Like the anti-semitic salute by a footballer.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We only need to look at recent atrocities in the Central African Republic to see \u2013 that one spark of intolerance quickly spreads to an untameable fire.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "Like Kemal Pervanitch\u2019s teacher \u2013 someone who he considered a role model \u2013 quickly became his torturer.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Kemal has poignantly said before,\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u201cI was a victim. Then I was a survivor. But all I wanted to be was a human being again.\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
