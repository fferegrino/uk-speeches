        "For the Prime Minister to describe questions about rape convictions as \u2018jabber\u2019 is disgraceful. But this is the man who once said investigating child sexual abuse was \u2018spaffing money up the wall\u2019 \u2013 he simply doesn\u2019t care about tackling sexual violence. He should apologise for his comments and his government\u2019s appalling record.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
