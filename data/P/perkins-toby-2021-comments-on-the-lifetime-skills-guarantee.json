Their limited plans will now leave millions unable to access the skills they need to play their part in our recovery.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Minister should urgently widen eligibility for the Lifetime Skills Guarantee to ensure it reaches all adults who could benefit.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association"
