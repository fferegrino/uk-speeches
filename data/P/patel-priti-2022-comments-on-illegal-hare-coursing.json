        "Illegal hare coursing has blighted rural communities for too long, resulting in criminal damage, threatening violence and intimidation against farmers and landowners.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Those responsible are often involved in other criminal activities \u2013 including drugs and firearms offences. I have been a longstanding supporter for essential reforms to our laws to stop hare coursing which is why we will act to prevent more people from suffering as a result of the actions of a law-breaking minority.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "We are introducing new measures in the Policing, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill to empower and equip the police and courts with the powers they need to combat this crime. They will deter those breaking the law, and send a clear message that we will do all we can to keep our rural communities safe.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association"
