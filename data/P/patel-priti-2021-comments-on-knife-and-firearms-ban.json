        "There is no place in our society for violent crime and harm caused by such knives and firearms.

        "The human suffering and hurt caused by the tragic loss of life through violent crime is unacceptable, which is why the government will stop at nothing to give the police the powers needed to stop violent crime and protect the public.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "From today, anyone possessing one of these deadly weapons unlawfully will face the full force of the law.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association"
