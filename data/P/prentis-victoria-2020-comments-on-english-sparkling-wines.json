        "It\u2019s fantastic that English sparkling wine is being increasingly recognised as the premium drink of choice to celebrate Christmas here in the UK.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Growers and producers in England set a high bar internationally, thanks to their thirst for innovation and due to unique methods of managing their estates.
