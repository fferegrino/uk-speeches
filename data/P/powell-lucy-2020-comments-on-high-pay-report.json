        "These figures will stick in the throat of many low paid workers who have gone above and beyond during this pandemic to keep our shelves stocked, care for older people and deliver goods across our country. They have been undervalued and underpaid for years. This can\u2019t go on.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "With the looming spectre of mass unemployment, Ministers must redouble their efforts to get excessive pay under control and make sure those on low incomes who have worked so hard to keep our country running get the pay they deserve.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
