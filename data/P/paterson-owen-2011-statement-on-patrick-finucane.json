        "In my written statement of 11 November, I set out a period of two months during which I would receive representations as to whether it is in the public interest that I should establish a public inquiry into the death of Patrick Finucane.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "As part of this process, my officials have had a constructive meeting with representatives of the Finucane family and a further meeting will be arranged. In light of the fact that useful discussions are underway between the family and the government, I have decided, with the agreement of the family, to extend the period during which I will receive representations by two months.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "When this further period has concluded it remains my intention to consider the family\u2019s views carefully and in detail, along with any other relevant representations I receive, before taking a decision as to whether or not it is in the public interest to hold a public inquiry into the death of Patrick Finucane.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association"
