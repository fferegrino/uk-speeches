        "The Chancellor of the Exchequer is in Washington, having meetings with the IMF, and is\u2014[Interruption.]\u2014which have been\u2014[Interruption.]\u2014routine meetings, which have been long scheduled.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "Order. I know it is the first Wednesday back; we are all excitable. Let us have a little calm, so that I can hear the Minister. Come on, Minister.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",

        "Thank you, Mr Speaker. They are routine meetings that have been long scheduled, and are certainly not a cause for exuberance or over-excitement from the Opposition.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "As we know, the world has faced surging energy prices since Putin\u2019s illegal invasion of Ukraine. We have seen very high inflation across the western world, and we have seen a cycle of increasing interest rates across western economies as well\u2014across many western economies. But let me reassure the House that the fundamentals of the United Kingdom\u2019s economy remain resilient. Unemployment, at 3.5%, is the lowest it has been in my lifetime\u2014and for the record, I was born in 1976. Economic growth last year, the calendar year 2021, was the highest of any G7 country\u20147.5%. Just yesterday the IMF forecast that economic growth\u2014GDP growth\u2014this current year in the UK would be at 3.6%\u2014once again, for the second consecutive year, the highest of any G7 country. So our economy is in resilient condition.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But I know that many families are worried about the challenges we face, and that is why, just a few weeks ago\u2014two or three weeks ago\u2014we introduced the energy price guarantee. Families were genuinely fearful that they might face this winter energy bills of three, four, five, six or even seven thousand pounds per year, but that energy price guarantee will ensure that the average household sees energy prices no higher than \u00a32,500 on average\u2014not for six months, like the Labour plan, but for two years.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We also introduced a growth plan to get our economy growing, to see wages sustainably rising, to see good jobs created and to create a sustainable tax base to fund our public services. This Government have a growth plan; the Opposition have no plan.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We intend to do this in a way that is fiscally responsible, and that is why\u2014[Interruption.]\u2014and that is why, on 31 October, in less than three weeks\u2019 time, the Chancellor of the Exchequer will set out the medium-term fiscal plan, explaining to the House exactly how he will do that, and how we will continue the UK\u2019s track record of having the highest growth in the G7, not just last year but this year as well.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
