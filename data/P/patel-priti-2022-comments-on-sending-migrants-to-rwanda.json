        "Britain\u2019s asylum system is broken as criminals exploit and smuggle people into our country at huge costs to UK taxpayers. The world-leading migration partnership with Rwanda means those making dangerous, unnecessary and illegal journeys to the UK may be relocated to Rwanda to have their claims for asylum considered and to rebuild their lives there \u2013 helping break the people smugglers\u2019 business model and prevent loss of life.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "This is just the first stage of the process and we know it will take time as some will seek to frustrate the process and delay removals. I will not be deterred from acting to deliver on the changes the British people voted for to take back control of our money, laws and borders.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association"
