        "The safety and security of UK citizens is the Government\u2019s top priority and the UK will continue to be one of the safest countries in the world. I\u2019m immensely proud of the comprehensive package of capabilities we\u2019ve agreed with the EU. It means both sides have effective tools to tackle serious crime and terrorism, protecting the public and bringing criminals to justice. But we will also seize this historic opportunity to make the UK safer and more secure through firmer and fairer border controls.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association"
