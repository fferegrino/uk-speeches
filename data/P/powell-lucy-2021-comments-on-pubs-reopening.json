        "These half measures would be deeply damaging for pubs and hospitality. Rather than forcing them to open but not sell alcohol, the Government should protect jobs and businesses by making the furlough scheme smart and giving businesses access to the emergency support they need \u2013 keeping it in place until necessary measures are lifted.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Ideas like this could see COVID cases rise and business thrown under the bus, needlessly. The vaccine gives us a way out:, the last thing businesses need now is ridiculous speculation about re-opening under unviable terms.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
