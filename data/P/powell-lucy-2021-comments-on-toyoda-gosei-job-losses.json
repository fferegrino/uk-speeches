        "This is really distressing news for workers at Toyoda Gosei who will be worried about their jobs, and for communities in Yorkshire and Swansea where these plants provide opportunities for good, high-skilled employment.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Conservatives have no plan for the car industry, having scrapped the industrial strategy and having failed to deliver the sector deal they need.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The drive to electric is an opportunity to help the industry to succeed, yet Ministers are failing to grasp it. Labour backs our automotive manufacturers and has set out plans for an electric vehicle revolution to back car businesses and protect and create jobs.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
