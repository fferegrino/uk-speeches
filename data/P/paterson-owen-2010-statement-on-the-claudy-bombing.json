    "content": [
        "The Claudy bombing was a terrible atrocity carried out by terrorists during the bloodiest year of the Troubles.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "I absolutely condemn the actions of the terrorists who were responsible.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "It was a despicable and evil act carried out by despicable and evil people.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "My anger at the actions of those responsible for the attack is matched in strength by my sorrow that the survivors of the atrocity and the relatives of the dead did not see those responsible brought to justice for their crimes.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "I recognise, of course, that all those involved in combating terrorism at the time were making decisions in exceptionally difficult circumstances and under extreme pressure.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "The Claudy bombings took place during a month which also witnessed the end of a temporary IRA ceasefire, the Bloody Friday bombings, Operation Motorman and widespread civil disorder and violence.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Nearly 100 people died in July 1972 alone, making it the most violent month in the most violent year of the Troubles.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "In relation to the interaction between the RUC, the then Secretary of State and the head of the Catholic Church in Ireland about Father Chesney, the Ombudsman\u2019s report states that \u201cthe actions of the senior RUC Officers, in seeking and accepting the government\u2019s assistance in dealing with the problem that Father Chesney\u2019s alleged wrongdoing presented, was by definition a collusive act.\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "With respect to the government, the Ombudsman observes that the government was \u201casked by police to assist in resolving a matter of public interest. They had a legitimate interest in doing so. In the course of this enquiry the Police Ombudsman\u2019s investigation found no evidence of any criminal intent on the part of any government minister or official.\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "In his conclusions, the Ombudsman finds that the RUC decision not to investigate Chesney was \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201ccontrary to a fundamental duty of police to investigate those suspected of criminality.\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "The PSNI have expressed their regret that opportunities to arrest and interview all of the suspects were not taken in 1972.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "For my part, on behalf of the government, I am profoundly sorry that Father Chesney was not properly investigated for his suspected involvement in this hideous crime, and that the victims and their families have been denied justice.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "In the course of their investigations both the PSNI and the Police Ombudsman have conducted enquiries with the Department. I can confirm that the Department\u2019s files have been extensively searched and that all relevant documents were provided to the Ombudsman.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "The only document referring to discussions about Father Chesney is **the letter of 6th December 1972** quoted in the Ombudsman\u2019s report.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "In the interests of transparency I am today publishing the document and will send a copy to the Public Record Office in Northern Ireland, the National Archives and the Linenhall Library.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association"
