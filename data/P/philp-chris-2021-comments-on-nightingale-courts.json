        "We have achieved an immense amount in our battle to keep justice moving during the pandemic \u2013 restarting jury trials before anyone else, turbo-charging the rollout of video technology, bringing magistrates\u2019 backlogs down, and opening more courtrooms for jury trials.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "These new courtrooms are the latest step in that effort, and I am determined to minimise delays and ensure justice is served for Londoners.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That is why we are investing hundreds of millions to drive this recovery further, deliver swifter justice and support victims.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
