        "CABINET Office efforts to suppress information don\u2019t get much more cynical than those designed to frustrate efforts to find out about the dubious government decision to invest \u00a3400m in bankrupt satellite business OneWeb last year.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Eye first asked several months ago for details of Boris Johnson\u2019s meetings and calls to set up what appeared to be a deal done on his and Dominic Cummings\u2019s whim. On no fewer than four occasions the Cabinet Office\u2019s coverer-up-in-chief, Nicholas Howard, told the Eye it would take an extra month to weigh up the public interest in disclosing information.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Only when forced to do so by the information commissioner did Howard provide the response he was obviously always going to: saying anything would harm the company\u2019s commercial interests.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
