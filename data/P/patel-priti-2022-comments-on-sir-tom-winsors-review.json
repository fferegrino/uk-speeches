        "In thanking Sir Tom for his report, I hope now that those responsible for delivering policing in London \u2013 as well as those responsible for holding the Met to account \u2013 will concentrate their efforts on delivering safer streets for the capital and restoring integrity in policing.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Public confidence in the Met has been dented by a series of appalling incidents and it is vital that failings are addressed and professional standards restored to the level that Londoners deserve.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "The police need to ensure that they get the basics right, which should include a relentless focus on cutting neighbourhood crime and the serious violence that has blighted too many communities.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association"
