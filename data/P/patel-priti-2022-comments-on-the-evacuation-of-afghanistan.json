        "The evacuation of Afghanistan was a race against time to get people out \u2013 the stakes had never been higher. The UK has a well-earned reputation for extending the hand of friendship to those in need and I am incredibly proud that nearly 21,500 people have so far made it to safety in the UK thanks to a huge government effort and the determination of the British public to help during very challenging, complex and intense circumstances.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "One year on, our work to help Afghans resettled in the UK has not stopped \u2013 there are still weekly flights, our resettlement schemes remain open and we will be welcoming thousands more people to our country. We are also doing everything possible to move families into homes and I urge landlords and local authorities to come forward with suitable accommodation.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association"
