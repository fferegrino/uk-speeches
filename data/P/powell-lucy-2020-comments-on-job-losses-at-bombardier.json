With the right action now the UK could lead the world in the green revolution in aerospace; no action will lead to devastation and long-term damage to communities which rely on these jobs.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
