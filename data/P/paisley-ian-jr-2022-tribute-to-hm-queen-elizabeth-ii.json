        "\u201cForgetting the things which are behind us, and reaching for the things that are before us, pressing on to the mark, to the high calling of God through Jesus Christ.\u201d The words of the apostle are not only the religious philosophy of our former monarch, but they indicate her style of leadership. She did not allow the past to be a burden. She did not allow the past to hold her back. She stretched forward constantly to the mark, shooing this country forward to a better place, to an ideal, to get over the line. Indeed, her Christmas speech each year summed that up, as she witnessed for her Lord and Saviour, for her God. I was deeply impressed and struck by the King\u2019s speech this evening, in which he powerfully and singularly dedicated himself to his mother\u2019s God. It should encourage us all that he learned from that example of urging this kingdom forward in all its strands and steps.",
        "My constituents are broken-hearted, as I am sure are yours, Mr Deputy Speaker, about what has happened to our kingdom over the last few hours, but they will be emboldened by the memories of Her Majesty\u2019s visits. On her last visit to North Antrim, she visited Bushmills. It looked like a box of Quality Street, with a contingent of the Irish Guards decked out in red tunics and S\u00e9amus the dog walking through the village. When the Queen arrived to unveil the statue of the war hero Robert Quigg, she said to me as I welcomed her, \u201cIs this all yours?\u201d I hesitated and said, \u201cNo, Ma\u2019am, this is yours.\u201d With a twinkle in her eye, she said, \u201cQuite.\u201d [Laughter.] I will never forget it; it was a lovely moment.",
        "King Charles also visited the constituency when he was Prince Charles. He was way down at Gracehill in Ballymena, but for some reason he too made it to Bushmills. I do not know what it is, but there is something about a liquid that sits in a barrel for 12 years that he seems to like. I know that my constituents are delighted by his patronage of Bushmills.",
        "Our kingdom is a lesser place, and we have lost a wonderful sovereign, but I want to repeat what the King said this evening:",
        "\u201cLet us\u2026draw strength from the light of her example.\u201d",
        "God save the King."
