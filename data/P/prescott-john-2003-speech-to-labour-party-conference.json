        "Conference, after six years in government I\u2019ve picked up a few titles.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Civil servants call me \u201cDPM\u201d. I\u2019m JP to my friends. To the press I\u2019m \u201cTwo Jags\u201d or \u201cFour pads\u201d. But the title that makes me the proudest is \u201cDL\u201d. DL? Deputy Leader. Deputy leader of the greatest party there is. The Labour party. A great party. A great conference.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We confounded the doom and gloom merchants in the press didn\u2019t we? They predicted disaster, a return to the 70s and 80s. The media saw blood on my collar during Monday\u2019s speech. That\u2019s progress. A few years ago, in the bad old days, they \u2018d have been reporting the blood all over the conference floor.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Last weekend the headlines predicted a week of reversals. We\u2019ve only had a couple. And now we know why, don\u2019t we? We haven\u2019t got a reverse gear. But as one delegate said yesterday, \u201cif you go in the right direction you don\u2019t really need one, do you?\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Yesterday we honoured two comrades. Jack Jones and Michael Foot who symbolise the two wings of our great movement: the industrial and the political. Never forget that. They did so much to make the party what it is today.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We didn\u2019t hear them speak, but then we didn\u2019t need to. Their life\u2019s work spoke volumes for them.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But we did hear two powerful speeches this week: one from Gordon, one from Tony. Weren\u2019t they magnificent? And you showed it, in the reception you gave them.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The press were shocked that a Labour MP, a Labour chancellor in a Labour government used the word \u201cLabour\u201d in a speech to Labour conference. And that a Labour prime minister, used the word \u201cLabour\u201d as well. Mind you, as many times as he said \u201cNew Labour\u201d, actually. It\u2019s funny, I\u2019ve been using the word \u201cLabour\u201d for years and no one\u2019s ever given me stick for it.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Two great speeches. Packed full of Labour values and Labour government achievements. That\u2019s the real story.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "We heard Gordon\u2019s passionate words:\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u201c\u2026 Labour policies have achieved the longest period of continuous and sustained economic growth in the last 50 years\u2026 and \u201cthere are today in Britain more people in work \u2013 28 million \u2013 than at any time in our history.\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And we heard Tony\u2019s powerful reminder that:\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u201c\u2026 we can be proud of the new money in our schools and health service, proud that this year, last year and next year, spending on health and education is rising faster here than in any other major country.\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That\u2019s economic competence and full employment, giving us \u2013 at long, long last \u2013 economic prosperity and social justice.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Wasn\u2019t that what we\u2019ve always wanted? Wasn\u2019t it why we fought through all those bitter Tory years? Why we worked so hard together?\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So, two powerful speeches from Tony and Gordon.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And this conference knows, this party knows, the whole country knows, that these two achieve more by their common endeavour than they do alone.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Conference, this is where we sort out our differences, within the party. I\u2019m pleased our debates have been open and constructive. That makes for better decisions. Progress means change, yes. And change is often controversial. But the most controversial issues are sometimes those that are least discussed.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So this week we\u2019ve debated foundation hospitals, tuition fees, PPPs, and pensions. All of them controversial. We all agree on what we want. Better hospitals, more investment in public services, more of our people going to university, dignity if retirement. But, of course, we have differences about how to achieve them.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I remember the huge row over the national minimum wage. Not about how much it should be. The other row. Many years ago. About whether to have one at all.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "A few of us battled hard against massed ranks of those claiming that a national minimum wage would destroy the principle of free collective bargaining.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So it was controversial. But we worked it through.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And so this week the trade unions were able to place full-page newspaper advert calling, amongst other things, for a higher minimum wage. A call made possible only because we\u2019ve now got a national minimum wage to raise.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It is a reality. And it\u2019s already lifted millions out of poverty pay.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So, it\u2019s important to have the debates, no matter how controversial.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Unfortunately too many people, in all parts of the party and on all sides of arguments, say, \u201clisten\u201d when they really mean \u201clisten and then do as I say\u201d.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Now Tony and I have our discussions. In private. And we have our ups and downs. But when we do disagree I don\u2019t rush out and issue a press release. Or brief the newspapers.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I do my job as the deputy leader. I do what you expect of me. I do my best to put the views of the party. Sometimes when we disagree he turns out to be wrong. It\u2019s good to know Tony\u2019s human. I was beginning to wonder.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But sometimes I turn out to be wrong. Take our clause 4.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Just after the two of us were elected, he told me he wanted to change the party\u2019s constitution. I said \u201cOh no\u201d, or words to that effect.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So I told him if we\u2019re going to do it, do it properly. Consult the wider party. Engage with members. Persuade them.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And we did. And it was a success. We adopted a more relevant statement of our values. Traditional values in a modern setting.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I especially like the first line, don\u2019t you? How does it go? \u201cWe are a democratic socialist party\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So I welcome participation and debate. I always have done.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And now we need to start a new debate, having the confidence to listen to the party and listen to the country.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "As Tony said on Tuesday: \u201cThis must not be a discussion just between us. Because if we want a government in touch with the party, we must have a party in touch with the people.\u201d\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But conference, I believe that any debate with the country must start within the party itself.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Every section of the party \u2013 all of us \u2013 must have a part in that process:\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u00b7 trade unionists \u2013 the legitimate voice of working people;\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u00b7 socialist societies, bringing so many new ideas to our debates;\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u00b7 MPs, assembly members and MEPs \u2013 working hard to represent their constituents;\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u00b7 Labour councillors \u2013 doing a difficult job with little thanks;\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u00b7 and party members \u2013 the lifeblood of our movement in local communities.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Let\u2019s remember though, that we must \u2013 all of us \u2013 be prepared to think it possible that we are mistaken. We must be prepared to be persuaded in the argument by the force of the argument. We must be prepared to change our minds.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But the right to be consulted brings with it an obligation to participate responsibly. But, I have to tell you, I have more chance of hearing the views of few of our more critical MPs on the TV, than in the place where we are supposed to air our differences: at the weekly meeting of the parliamentary Labour party.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And when I go to party events around the country, hard-working party activists ask me \u201cwhy do Labour MPs write articles, especially in the Tory Daily Mail, attacking a Labour government?\u201d Even during the critical Brent byelection.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I have to tell them, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d, \u201cI can\u2019t understand it myself\u201d.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Mind you, chair, I should declare an interest. I\u2019ve had an offer myself. Don\u2019t laugh \u2013 it\u2019s good money. All I have to do is write my memoirs.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Daily Mail say they\u2019ll serialise it. And another newspaper wants a weekly column. All for six-figure sums apparently.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But I looked at the small print. First, it said I have to resign from the cabinet. Second, no articles supporting Labour. To earn that kind of money I\u2019ve got to do something else: I\u2019ve got to slag off the government and my former colleagues.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Then it says: \u201cdon\u2019t worry if you take a different position now to the one you took in cabinet \u2013 we\u2019ll just say that shows what an independent thinker you are\u201d.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Well conference, I haven\u2019t been an MP for 33 years just to use the Daily Mail to attack any Labour government, let alone this one.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So let me say to those in our party who claim that the government has betrayed Labour\u2019s values.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Our achievements would have been celebrated by our party at any time in its history.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Keir Hardie would have rejoiced at our implementation of his minimum wage. Nye Bevan could only dream of the level of investment we are making in his health service.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Any Labour leader, at any time in history, would be proud that we are lifting millions of our children out of absolute poverty, and cutting the debt burden of the poorest nations in the world.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "That\u2019s not betrayal. I call it democratic socialism.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "So listening is important. Proper debate is important and respect for other people\u2019s opinions is important too\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But so is leadership. And we\u2019ve been reminded of that this week, haven\u2019t we?\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Seeing Tony in action underlines just what a great leader we have.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "On Sierra Leone, on Kosovo, on Afghanistan and, yes, on Iraq, when he saw the need to act, he acted. As a leader. He couldn\u2019t walk by on the other side.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And what was the result? Small children no longer have their arms and legs hacked off in a vicious civil war in Sierra Leone. Ethnic cleansing in Kosovo stopped. A million Muslims back home, rebuilding their country. And the brutal yoke of the Taliban lifted in Afghanistan.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Yesterday President Karzai gave us a powerful account of the emerging democracy in his country. One and a half million girls now back at school and two million refugees returned home.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And on Iraq, I know there are strongly held views on both sides. And the debate will continue, especially over weapons of mass destruction.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Today a statement on the Interim Report of the Iraq Survey Group will be published. The media are already carrying what they claim to be leaks from the report. All I have to say to those who doubted our action against Saddam is: wait until the report is published.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And, as Ann Clwyd reminded us so powerfully yesterday, surely, there can be no remaining doubt that the Iraqi people live in a better country today without Saddam Hussein.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Conference, that\u2019s our leader. Providing serious leadership. Facing tough choices. Taking monumental decisions.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "But let\u2019s look at the competition. When the voters face a choice let\u2019s look at the alternative leadership on offer.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "The Liberals. Charlie Kennedy.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "He\u2019s made a momentous decision recently. With lasting implications for his party and the whole nation.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Conference, Charles Kennedy has ended Liberal co-operation with Labour.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I am devastated. I never quite managed to make it to Lib/Lab liaison meetings and now I never will.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Charlie\u2019s leadership: Talking left and acting right, or vice versa, depending on the audience.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Charlie\u2019s economic policy: more government spending all round and no way to fund it.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It\u2019s like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory: as many sweeties as you like and you don\u2019t have to pay for any of them.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And now there\u2019s Charlie\u2019s cunning plan to replace the Tories. His message to his troops: \u201cgo back to your constituencies and prepare for opposition\u201d Another 80 years of it. That\u2019s fine by us, isn\u2019t it?\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And the Tories. Iain Duncan Smith.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "He made a momentous decision too.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "He wants to change the face of the Conservative party. Literally.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "He\u2019s spent \u00a3100,000 on a makeover. I\u2019m not kidding. A personal image consultant. So he can, I quote, \u201cwalk, talk, and look the part\u201d.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "He\u2019s learning how to shake hands properly. Well, it\u2019s a lot of money and it might well buy him a different handshake. But I tell you, it won\u2019t give him a firmer grip on reality. Or his party. Or his job.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "He\u2019s also been taught \u201cnew hand gestures\u201d for when he\u2019s speaking. Hand gestures? I\u2019ll give him a hand gesture. And I\u2019ll give him it for free.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "It\u2019s old. It\u2019s traditional. And it\u2019s the same gesture the British people will give him \u2013 and the rest of his gang \u2013 at the next general election.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Now, while I\u2019m on the subject of elections, there\u2019s a few coming up.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Next year we\u2019ll have them for: the European parliament, the London assembly and thousands of local council seats up and down the country.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "And, conference, there\u2019ll be an opportunity for people across the north-west, north-east and Yorkshire & Humberside to vote in referendums to establish, for the first time ever, their own directly elected regional assemblies.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "At the last two general elections we had pledge cards. Do you remember them?\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I toured the constituencies signing them.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "I have to tell you I was a bit worried that we wouldn\u2019t achieve all 10 pledges in 10 years. Well did it. Not in 10 years. We did it in six years!\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "Here\u2019s just 4 of those achievements:\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "\u00b7 A stable economy; smaller class sizes; youth unemployment down; shorter hospital waiting lists.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
