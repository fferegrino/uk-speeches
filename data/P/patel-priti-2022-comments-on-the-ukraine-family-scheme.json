        "Our expanded Ukraine Family Scheme is now fully open and to see the first people who will apply was wonderful. While we want people to be able to return to their homes at the end of this diabolical invasion, giving thousands of people a route to the UK is the right thing to do.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "The whole of the UK is united in our condemnation of Russia\u2019s barbaric and cold-blooded actions and the government is doing everything possible to make certain our humanitarian support is in Ukraine\u2019s best interests.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association"
