        "The Business Secretary needs to stand up for businesses in government not stand back and leave them to go bust. It\u2019s his job to be their strong voice, not a Treasury mouthpiece.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "A million firms are struggling with a cash crisis threatening jobs and livelihoods just as the vaccine offers hope. The cost of business insolvencies and unemployment on this scale would take a wrecking-ball to our economy.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners",
        "If the Government fails to act on this latest evidence, and doesn\u2019t bring forward an urgent, comprehensive plan, they\u2019ll be guilty of economic negligence that will choke off the recovery, and damage our country for years to come.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association\n  *[HS2]: High Speed Two\n  *[GPs]: general practitioners"
