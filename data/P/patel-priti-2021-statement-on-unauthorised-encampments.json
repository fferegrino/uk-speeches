        "Today, I am announcing the Government\u2019s response to the November 2019 consultation entitled, \u201cStrengthening Police Powers to Tackle Unauthorised Encampments\u201d. The consultation sought views on how to address and prevent the harm and distress caused by some unauthorised encampments and followed a public consultation in 2018 which demonstrated support for more police action.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "The vast majority of travellers are law-abiding citizens. As of January 2020, the number of lawful traveller sites increased by 41% from January 2010. However, there continue to be unauthorised encampments that can create significant challenges for local authorities and cause distress and misery to many. Harmful or disruptive encampments can also perpetuate a negative image of travelling communities.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "I will therefore introduce legislation to increase the powers available to the police in England and Wales. As we pledged in our manifesto, we will create a new criminal offence to tackle unauthorised encampments. In addition, we will give the police the power to seize vehicles, and we will strengthen existing powers.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "The measures complement the ongoing work by MHCLG to strengthen councils\u2019 powers to tackle unauthorised developments\u2014building on land that an occupier owns without planning permission.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "**Introduce a criminal offence of residing on land with a vehicle, causing damage, disruption or distress**\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "A person will commit an offence if they:\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Are aged 18 or over and reside or intend to reside on land without the consent of the occupier of the land;\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Have or intend to have at least one vehicle with them on the land;\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Have caused or are likely to cause significant damage, disruption or distress; and\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "They:\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Fail, without a reasonable excuse, to leave the land with their vehicle and/or property once asked to do so by the occupier, representatives of the occupier or a constable; or\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "They, without reasonable excuse, enter, or re-enter the land with an intention of residing there without the consent of the occupier, and they have or intend to have a vehicle with them, within 12 months of a request to leave and remove their property from an occupier, their representative or a constable.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "**Give police the power to seize any property including vehicles from those committing the new offence**\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "The police will be empowered to seize any property including vehicles owned or in the possession of the individual on the land if they reasonably suspect that the person has committed the above offence.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "**Strengthen existing powers**\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "Section 61(1)(a) of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (\u201cCJPOA\u201d) sets out the power of the police to direct trespassers away from land. We will amend this section to enable the police to direct trespassers away in a broader range of circumstances, including if there is damage to the environment, such as excessive noise, litter or deposits of waste, and if there is disruption to supplies of water, energy or fuel.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "We also intend to increase the period in which persons directed away from the land under section 61 and 62A of the CJPOA must not return\u2014without reasonable excuse\u2014without committing an offence or being subject to powers of seizure from three months to 12 by amending section 61(4)(b) 62B(2) and section 62C(2)of the CJPOA.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "We will in addition strengthen measures to tackle unauthorised encampments on roads by amending section 61(9)(b) to allow police to direct trespassers to leave land that forms part of a highway.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "I am grateful to everyone who took the time to respond to the two consultations carried out by the Government on this issue. The views expressed in response have all been considered and have informed the decisions we have made.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "The measures I intend to introduce are a proportionate increase in powers for the police. I hope they will deter unauthorised encampments from being set up in the first instance but, where that is not the case, they will allow the police to take more effective action in response to an encampment causing damage, disruption or distress, in support of those communities living with or near them.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "I am confident that we have taken steps to ensure those wishing to exercise their rights to enjoy the countryside are not inadvertently impacted by these measures.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "The response to the consultation will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses and will also be available at:\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
