        "Anyone who meets victims of terrorism, especially young victims, cannot fail to be moved by the personal tragedy that they have suffered. But the contrast between the positive hope and inspiration of these young people and the emptiness of those who visited evil upon them could not be more stark.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association",
        "There are still a small number people in our community intent on creating more victims, as evidenced in Londonderry and Bangor this week. The young people of Project Common Bond put them to shame.\n  *[ERSA]: Employment Related Services Association"
